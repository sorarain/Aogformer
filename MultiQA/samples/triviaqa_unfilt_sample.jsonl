                "title": "Australia",
                "text": "Australia (,,),   officially the Commonwealth of Australia,  is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries include Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.\n\nFor about 50,000 years  before the first British settlement in the late 18th century,   Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, \nwho spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups.   After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies were established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast. \n\nAustralia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2014 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income.  Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights.  Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.\n\nName\n\nThe name Australia (pronounced in Australian English ) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis (\"southern land\") a name used for putative lands in the southern hemisphere since ancient times.  The earliest recorded use of the word Australia in English was in 1625 in \"A note of Australia del Esp\u00edritu Santo, written by Sir Richard Hakluyt\", published by Samuel Purchas in Hakluytus Posthumus, a corruption of the original Spanish name \"Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo\" (Southern Land of the Holy Spirit)    for an island in Vanuatu.  The Dutch adjectival form Australische was used in a Dutch book in Batavia (Jakarta) in 1638, to refer to the newly discovered lands to the south. \nThe first time that the name Australia appears to have been officially used was in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of 4 April 1817 in which Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Matthew Flinders' charts of Australia.  On 12 December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.  In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia. \n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\n\nHuman habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago,   possibly with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia. These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians.  At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century, most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers, with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime. The Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically Melanesian, were originally horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.  The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia. \n\nEuropean arrival\n\nThe first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon. He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.Davison, Hirst and Macintyre, p. 233. The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, but made no attempt at settlement. William Dampier, an English explorer and privateer, landed on the north-west coast of New Holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip.  In 1770, James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain.  With the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the \"First Fleet\", under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day, Australia Day, although the British Crown Colony of New South Wales was not formally promulgated until 7 February 1788. The first settlement led to the foundation of Sydney, and the exploration and settlement of other regions.\n\nA British settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land, now known as Tasmania, in 1803, and it became a separate colony in 1825.  The United Kingdom formally claimed the western part of Western Australia (the Swan River Colony) in 1828.  Separate colonies were carved from parts of New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.  The Northern Territory was founded in 1911 when it was excised from South Australia.  South Australia was founded as a \"free province\"\u2014it was never a penal colony.  Victoria and Western Australia were also founded \"free\", but later accepted transported convicts.   A campaign by the settlers of New South Wales led to the end of convict transportation to that colony; the last convict ship arrived in 1848. \n\nThe indigenous population, estimated to have been between 750,000 and 1,000,000 in 1788, declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.  Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.  A government policy of \"assimilation\" beginning with the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 resulted in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communities\u2014often referred to as the Stolen Generations\u2014a practice which may also have contributed to the decline in the indigenous population.  The Federal government gained the power to make laws with respect to Aborigines following the 1967 referendum.  Traditional ownership of land\u2014aboriginal title\u2014was not recognised until 1992, when the High Court case Mabo v Queensland (No 2) overturned the legal doctrine that Australia had been terra nullius (\"land belonging to no one\") before the European occupation. \n\nColonial expansion\n\nA gold rush began in Australia in the early 1850s  and the Eureka Rebellion against mining licence fees in 1854 was an early expression of civil disobedience.  Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.  The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs,  defence,  and international shipping.\n\nNationhood\n\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting.  This established the Commonwealth of Australia as a dominion of the British Empire. The Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.  The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.  In 1914, Australia joined Britain in fighting World War I, with support from both the outgoing Commonwealth Liberal Party and the incoming Australian Labor Party.   Australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front.  Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.  Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli as the birth of the nation\u2014its first major military action.   The Kokoda Track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during World War II. \n\nBritain's Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the UK. Australia adopted it in 1942,  but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II.   The shock of the United Kingdom's defeat in Asia in 1942 and the threat of Japanese invasion caused Australia to turn to the United States as a new ally and protector.  Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US, under the ANZUS treaty.  After World War II Australia encouraged immigration from Europe. Since the 1970s and following the abolition of the White Australia policy, immigration from Asia and elsewhere was also promoted.  As a result, Australia's demography, culture, and self-image were transformed.  The final constitutional ties between Australia and the UK were severed with the passing of the Australia Act 1986, ending any British role in the government of the Australian States, and closing the option of judicial appeals to the Privy Council in London.  In a 1999 referendum, 55% of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two-thirds vote in both Houses of the Australian Parliament. Since the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972,  there has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other Pacific Rim nations, while maintaining close ties with Australia's traditional allies and trading partners. \n\nGovernment\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy  with Elizabeth II at its apex as the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The Queen is represented in Australia by the Governor-General at the federal level and by the Governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of her ministers.   The most notable exercise to date of the Governor-General's reserve powers outside the Prime Minister's request was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975. \n\nThe federal government is separated into three branches:\n* The legislature: the bicameral Parliament, defined in section 1 of the constitution as comprising the Queen (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate, and the House of Representatives;\n* The executive: the Federal Executive Council, which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet, comprising the prime minister and ministers of state who advise the Governor-General; \n* The judiciary: the High Court of Australia and other federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Governor-General on advice of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nIn the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). The House of Representatives (the lower house) has 150 members elected from single-member electoral divisions, commonly known as \"electorates\" or \"seats\", allocated to states on the basis of population,  with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats.  Elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously; senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house; thus only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.\n\nAustralia's electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which, along with the Senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction,  as is enrolment (with the exception of South Australia).  The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament. \n\nThere are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.   Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left.  Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses.\n\nThe most recent federal election was held on 7 September 2013 and resulted in a majority government for the Coalition. Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott was sworn into office as Prime Minister by the Governor-General of Australia on 18 September. In September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull successfully challenged Abbott for leadership of the Coalition, and was sworn in as the 29th Prime Minister of Australia. \n\nStates and territories\n\nAustralia has six states\u2014New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS), Victoria (VIC) and Western Australia (WA)\u2014and two major mainland territories\u2014the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT). In most respects these two territories function as states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only in areas that are set out in Section 51 of the Australian Constitution; state parliaments retain all residual legislative powers, including those over schools, state police, the state judiciary, roads, public transport and local government, since these do not fall under the provisions listed in Section 51. \n\nEach state and major mainland territory has its own parliament\u2014unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a Governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator.  In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General. \n\nThe federal parliament directly administers the following territories:\n* Ashmore and Cartier Islands\n* Australian Antarctic Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Coral Sea Islands\n* Heard Island and McDonald Islands\n* Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales\n\nThe external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen.  In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. \n\nMacquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales.\n\nForeign relations and military\n\nOver recent decades, Australia's foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the United States through the ANZUS pact, and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and in 2011 attended the Sixth East Asia Summit in Indonesia. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. \n\nAustralia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation.  It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.   Australia is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organization,   and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the Australia\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement  and Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand,  with another free trade agreement being negotiated with China\u2014the Australia\u2013China Free Trade Agreement\u2014and Japan,  South Korea in 2011,   Australia\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement, and as of November 2015 has put the Trans-Pacific Partnership before parliament for ratification. \n\nAlong with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is party to the Five Power Defence Arrangements, a regional defence agreement. A founding member country of the United Nations, Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism  and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005\u201306 budget provides A$2.5\u00a0billion for development assistance.  Australia ranks fifteenth overall in the Center for Global Development's 2012 Commitment to Development Index. \n\nAustralia's armed forces\u2014the Australian Defence Force (ADF)\u2014comprise the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), in total numbering 81,214 personnel (including 57,982 regulars and 23,232 reservists) as of November 2015. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the Governor-General, who appoints a Chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government.  Day-to-day force operations are under the command of the Chief, while broader administration and the formulation of defence policy is undertaken by the Minister and Department of Defence.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 budget, defence spending was A$31.9 billion or 1.92% of GDP,  representing the 13th largest defence budget.  Australia has been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping, disaster relief and armed conflict, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq; it currently has deployed about 2,241 personnel in varying capacities to 12 international operations in areas including Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nGeography and climate\n\nAustralia's landmass of 7617930 km2  is on the Indo-Australian Plate. Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The world's smallest continent  and sixth largest country by total area,  Australia\u2014owing to its size and isolation\u2014is often dubbed the \"island continent\",  and is sometimes considered the world's largest island.  Australia has 34218 km of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),  and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8148250 km2. This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.  Apart from Macquarie Island, Australia lies between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 44\u00b0S, and longitudes 112\u00b0 and 154\u00b0E.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2000 km. Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,  is located in Western Australia. At 2228 m, Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2745 m), on the remote Australian territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3492 m and 3355 m respectively. \n\nAustralia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre.  It is the flattest continent,  with the oldest and least fertile soils;   desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land.  The driest inhabited continent, its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500\u00a0mm. The population density, 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, is among the lowest in the world,  although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline. \n\nEastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range, which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland, New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills, and the highlands are typically no more than 1600 m in height.  The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland.  These include the western plains of New South Wales, and the Einasleigh Uplands, Barkly Tableland, and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested Cape York Peninsula.    \n\nThe landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Countrywith their tropical climateinclude forest, woodland, wetland, grassland, rainforest and desert.    At the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley, and below that the Pilbara. To the south of these and inland, lie more areas of grassland: the Ord Victoria Plain and the Western Australian Mulga shrublands.    At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia. Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock), the famous sandstone monolith, and the inland Simpson, Tirari and Sturt Stony, Gibson, Great Sandy, Tanami, and Great Victoria deserts, with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast.    \n\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.   These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon) climate. The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.  Much of the south-east (including Tasmania) is temperate.\n\nEnvironment\n\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. Fungi typify that diversity; an estimated 250,000 species\u2014of which only 5% have been described\u2014occur in Australia.  Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.  Australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country, with 755 species. \n\nAustralian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species, particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions; wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts. Among well-known Australian animals are the monotremes (the platypus and echidna); a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, and wombat, and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra. Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world.  The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE.  Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement,  including the Australian megafauna; others have disappeared since European settlement, among them the thylacine.  \n\nMany of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced animal, chromistan, fungal and plant species.  All these factors have led to Australia having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world.  The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species.  Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;   65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention,  and 16 natural World Heritage Sites have been established.  Australia was ranked 3rd out of 178 countries in the world on the 2014 Environmental Performance Index.\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nProtection of the environment is a major political issue in Australia.   In 2007, the First Rudd Government signed the instrument of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Nevertheless, Australia's carbon dioxide emissions per capita are among the highest in the world, lower than those of only a few other industrialised nations.  Rainfall in southwestern Australia has decreased by 10\u201320% since the 1970s, while southeastern Australia has also experienced a moderate decline since the 1990s. \n\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology's 2011 Australian Climate Statement, Australia had lower than average temperatures in 2011 as a consequence of a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern; however, \"the country's 10-year average continues to demonstrate the rising trend in temperatures, with 2002\u20132011 likely to rank in the top two warmest 10-year periods on record for Australia, at  above the long-term average\".  Furthermore, 2014 was Australia's third warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910.   Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought.   Throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in 2010, 2011 and 2012 after the 2000s Australian drought.\n\nA carbon tax was introduced in 2012 and helped to reduce Australia's emissions but was scrapped in 2014 under the Liberal Government.  Since the carbon tax was repealed, emissions have again continued to rise. \n\nAustralian biota has been severely impacted by changes occurring since European settlement began in 1788,  with more than 10% of mammal species lost in the past 225 years.  There have also been 23 bird species or subspecies,  4 amphibians and more than 60 plant species known to be lost during this period. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999 was designed to minimise further impacts on ecological communities in Australia and its territories. \n\nEconomy\n\nAustralia is a wealthy country; it generates its income from various sources including mining-related exports, telecommunications, banking and manufacturing.    It has a market economy, a relatively high GDP per capita, and a relatively low rate of poverty. In terms of average wealth, Australia ranked second in the world after Switzerland in 2013, although the nation's poverty rate increased from 10.2% to 11.8%, from 2000/01 to 2013.  It was identified by the Credit Suisse Research Institute as the nation with the highest median wealth in the world and the second-highest average wealth per adult in 2013. \n\nThe Australian dollar is the currency for the nation, including Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island, as well as the independent Pacific Island states of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. With the 2006 merger of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange became the ninth largest in the world. \n\nRanked third in the Index of Economic Freedom (2010),  Australia is the world's twelfth largest economy and has the fifth highest per capita GDP (nominal) at $66,984. The country was ranked second in the United Nations 2011 Human Development Index and first in Legatum's 2008 Prosperity Index. All of Australia's major cities fare well in global comparative livability surveys;  Melbourne reached top spot for the fourth year in a row on The Economists 2014 list of the world's most liveable cities, followed by Adelaide, Sydney, and Perth in the fifth, seventh, and ninth places respectively.  Total government debt in Australia is about $190 billion  \u2013 20% of GDP in 2010.  Australia has among the highest house prices and some of the highest household debt levels in the world. \n\nAn emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactured goods has underpinned a significant increase in Australia's terms of trade since the start of the 21st century, due to rising commodity prices. Australia has a balance of payments that is more than 7% of GDP negative, and has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years.  Australia has grown at an average annual rate of 3.6% for over 15 years, in comparison to the OECD annual average of 2.5%. Australia was the only advanced economy not to experience a recession due to the global financial downturn in 2008\u20132009.  However, the economies of six of Australia's major trading partners have been in recession, which in turn has affected Australia, significantly hampering its economic growth in recent years.   From 2012 to early 2013, Australia's national economy grew, but some non-mining states and Australia's non-mining economy experienced a recession.   \n\nThe Hawke Government floated the Australian dollar in 1983 and partially deregulated the financial system.  The Howard Government followed with a partial deregulation of the labour market and the further privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the telecommunications industry.  The indirect tax system was substantially changed in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST).  In Australia's tax system, personal and company income tax are the main sources of government revenue. \n\nIn May 2012, there were 11,537,900\u00a0people employed (either full- or part-time), with an unemployment rate of 5.1%.  Youth unemployment (15\u201324) stood at 11.2%. Data released in mid-November 2013 showed that the number of welfare recipients had grown by 55%. In 2007 228,621 Newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered, a total that increased to 646,414 in March 2013.  According to the Graduate Careers Survey, full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from various occupations has declined since 2011 but it increases for graduates three years after graduation.  \n\nSince 2008, inflation has typically been 2\u20133% and the base interest rate 5\u20136%. The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, accounts for about 70% of GDP.  Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, particularly wheat and wool, minerals such as iron-ore and gold, and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although agriculture and natural resources account for only 3% and 5% of GDP respectively, they contribute substantially to export performance. Australia's largest export markets are Japan, China, the US, South Korea, and New Zealand.  Australia is the world's fourth largest exporter of wine, and the wine industry contributes $5.5 billion per year to the nation's economy. \n\nDemographics\n\nUntil the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles, and a majority of Australians have some British or Irish ancestry. In the 2011 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were English (36.1%), Australian (35.4%),  Irish (10.4%), Scottish (8.9%), Italian (4.6%), German (4.5%), Chinese (4.3%), Indian (2.0%), Greek (1.9%), and Dutch (1.7%).\n\nAustralia's population has quadrupled since the end of World War I,  much of this increase from immigration. Following World War II and through to 2000, almost 5.9\u00a0million of the total population settled in the country as new immigrants, meaning that nearly two out of every seven Australians were born in another country.  Most immigrants are skilled,  but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees. By 2050, Australia's population is currently projected to reach around 42 million.  Nevertheless, its population density, 2.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, remains among the lowest in the world. As such, Australians have more living space per person than the inhabitants of any other nation. \n\nIn 2011, 24.6% of Australians were born elsewhere and 43.1% of people had at least one overseas-born parent;  the five largest immigrant groups were those from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, China, India, and Vietnam. Following the abolition of the White Australia policy in 1973, numerous government initiatives have been established to encourage and promote racial harmony based on a policy of multiculturalism.  In 2005\u201306, more than 131,000\u00a0people emigrated to Australia, mainly from Asia and Oceania.  The migration target for 2012\u201313 is 190,000,  compared to 67,900 in 1998\u201399. \n\nThe Indigenous population\u2014Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders\u2014was counted at 548,370 (2.5% of the total population) in 2011,  a significant increase from 115,953 in the 1976 census.  The increase is partly due to many people with Indigenous heritage previously having been overlooked by the census due to undercount and cases where their Indigenous status had not been recorded on the form. Indigenous Australians experience higher than average rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education, and life expectancies for males and females that are, respectively, 11 and 17 years lower than those of non-indigenous Australians.   Some remote Indigenous communities have been described as having \"failed state\"-like conditions. \n\nIn common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2004, the average age of the civilian population was 38.8 years.  A large number of Australians (759,849 for the period 2002\u201303;  1 million or 5% of the total population in 2005 ) live outside their home country.\n\nLanguage\n\nAlthough Australia has no official language, English has always been entrenched as the de facto national language. \"English has no de jure status but it is so entrenched as the common language that it is de facto the official language as well as the national language.\" Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,  and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.  General Australian serves as the standard dialect. According to the 2011 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 81% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (1.7%), Italian (1.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.3%), Greek (1.3%), and Vietnamese (1.2%); a considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. A 2010\u20132011 study by the Australia Early Development Index found the most common language spoken by children after English was Arabic, followed by Vietnamese, Greek, Chinese, and Hindi.  \n\nOver 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact, of which less than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups.  About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people. At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.  Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main language of about 5,500 deaf people. \n\nReligion\n\nAustralia has no state religion; Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the federal government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion.  In the 2011 census, 61.1% of Australians were counted as Christian, including 25.3% as Roman Catholic and 17.1% as Anglican; 22.3% of the population reported having \"no religion\"; 7.2% identify with non-Christian religions, the largest of these being Buddhism (2.5%), followed by Islam (2.2%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Judaism (0.5%). The remaining 9.4% of the population did not provide an adequate answer. \n\nBefore European settlement, the animist beliefs of Australia's indigenous people had been practised for many thousands of years. Mainland Aboriginal Australians' spirituality is known as the Dreamtime and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. The spirituality and customs of Torres Strait Islanders, who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion. \n\nSince the arrival of the First Fleet of British ships in 1788, Christianity has grown to be the major religion practised in Australia. Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia. For much of Australian history the Church of England (now known as the Anglican Church of Australia) was the largest religious denomination. However, multicultural immigration has contributed to a decline in its relative position, and the Roman Catholic Church has benefitted from recent immigration to become the largest group. Similarly, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism have all grown in Australia over the past half-century. \n\nAustralia has one of the lowest levels of religious adherence in the world.  In 2001, only 8.8% of Australians attended church on a weekly basis. \n\nEducation\n\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling,  is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is the responsibility of the individual states and territories  so the rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16.   In some states (e.g., Western Australia,  the Northern Territory  and New South Wales  ), children aged 16\u201317 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.\n\nAustralia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003. However, a 2011\u201312 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Tasmania has a literacy and numeracy rate of only 50%.  In the Programme for International Student Assessment, Australia regularly scores among the top five of thirty major developed countries (member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Catholic education accounts for the largest non-government sector.\n\nAustralia has 37 government-funded universities and two private universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level.  The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university.  There is a state-based system of vocational training, known as TAFE, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.  About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications, and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the highest among OECD countries. The ratio of international to local students in tertiary education in Australia is the highest in the OECD countries.  In addition, 38 percent of Australia's population has a university or college degree, which is among the highest percentages in the world.  \n\nHealth\n\nAustralia has the third and seventh highest life expectancy of males and females respectively in the world.  Life expectancy in Australia in 2010 was 79.5 years for males and 84.0 years for females.  Australia has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,  while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%.   Australia ranks 35th in the world  and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults   and nearly two thirds (63%) of its adult population is either overweight or obese.\n\nTotal expenditure on health (including private sector spending) is around 9.8% of GDP. Australia introduced universal health care in 1975.  Known as Medicare, it is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy, currently set at 1.5%.  The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (subsidising the costs of medicines) and general practice.\n\nCulture\n\nSince 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture, with some Indigenous influences.   The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.Davison, Hirst and Macintyre, pp. 98\u201399.  Since the mid-20th century, American popular culture has strongly influenced Australia, particularly through television and cinema.Teo and White, pp. 121\u201323. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations. \n\nArts\n\nThe rock art of Australia's Indigenous peoples is the oldest and richest in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years and spread across hundreds of thousands of sites.  Traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\";  its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.  During the first century of European settlement, colonial artists, trained in Europe, showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land. The naturalistic, sun-filled works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and others associated with the 19th-century Heidelberg School\u2014the first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art\u2014gave expression to a burgeoning Australian nationalism in the lead-up to Federation.[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/discover-art/learn-more/australian-art/ Australian art], Art Gallery of New South Wales. Retrieved 27 August 2014. While the school remained influential into the new century, modernists such as Margaret Preston, and, later, Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd, explored new artistic trends. The landscape remained a central subject matter for Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-World War II artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.  The National Gallery of Australia and state galleries maintain collections of Australian and international art.  Australia has one of the world's highest attendances of art galleries and museums per head of population. \n\nAustralian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.  19th-century writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary. Their works are still very popular; Paterson's bush poem \"Waltzing Matilda\" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.  Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.  Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.  Australian winners of the Booker Prize include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.  Author David Malouf, playwright David Williamson and poet Les Murray are also renowned literary figures.  \n\nMany of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the federal government's Australia Council.  There is a symphony orchestra in each state,  and a national opera company, Opera Australia,  well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers.  Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company. \n\nMedia\n\nThe Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature length film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.  After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,  and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.  With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Wake in Fright and Gallipoli,  while \"Crocodile\" Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters.  In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.  The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger. \n\nAustralia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 18th on a list of 178 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (19th) and United States (20th).  This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;  most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Fairfax Media. \n\nCuisine\n\nMost Indigenous Australian tribal groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.   The first settlers introduced British food to the continent, much of which is now considered typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast. Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine; post-World War II European migrants, particularly from the Mediterranean, helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture, and the influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their staple foods, such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll.  Vegemite, pavlova, lamingtons and meat pies are regarded as iconic Australian foods.  Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.\n\nSport and recreation\n\nAbout 24% of Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities. At an international level, Australia has excelled at cricket, field hockey, netball, rugby league and rugby union.  The majority of Australians live within the coastal zone, making the beach a popular recreation spot and an integral part of the nation's identity.  Australia is a powerhouse in water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.  The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.  Nationally, other popular sports include Australian rules football, horse racing, basketball, surfing, soccer, and motor racing. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race attract intense interest. \n\nAustralia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,  and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.  Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,  hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and will host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.  Australia made its inaugural appearance at the Pacific Games in 2015. As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant, Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup once \u2013 the only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations.  The country regularly competes among the world elite basketball teams as it is among the global top three teams in terms of qualifications to the Basketball Tournament at the Summer Olympics. Other major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament, international cricket matches, and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The highest-rating television programs include sports telecasts such as the Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup, The Ashes, Rugby League State of Origin, and the grand finals of the National Rugby League and Australian Football League.  Skiing in Australia began in the 1860s and snow sports take place in the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania.",

                "title": "Prohibition",
                "text": "Prohibition is the act of prohibiting the manufacturing, storage in barrels or bottles, transportation, sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol including alcoholic beverages. The term can also apply to periods in the histories of countries during which the prohibition of alcohol was enforced.\n\nHistory\n\nThe earliest records of prohibition of alcohol date to the Xia Dynasty (ca. 2070 BC\u2013ca. 1600 BC) in China. Yu the Great, the first ruler of the Xia Dynasty, prohibited alcohol throughout the kingdom.  It was legalized again after his death, during the reign of his son Qi.  \nAnother record was in the Code of Hammurabi (ca.1772 BCE) specifically banning the selling of beer for money.  It could only be bartered for barley: \"If a beer seller do not receive barley as the price for beer, but if she receive money or make the beer a measure smaller than the barley measure received, they shall throw her into the water.\"  (from Pearson textbook \"Arts and Culture, An Introduction to the Humanities\", Volume One, Fourth Edition, Benton & DiYanni, pg. 16).\n\nIn the early twentieth century, much of the impetus for the prohibition movement in the Nordic countries and North America came from moralistic convictions of pietistic Protestants.  Prohibition movements in the West coincided with the advent of women's suffrage, with newly empowered women as part of the political process strongly supporting policies that curbed alcohol consumption.  \n\nThe first half of the 20th century saw periods of prohibition of alcoholic beverages in several countries:\n* 1907 to 1948 in Prince Edward Island,  and for shorter periods in other provinces in Canada\n* 1907 to 1992 in the Faroe Islands; limited private imports from Denmark were allowed from 1928\n* 1914 to 1925  in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union\n* 1915 to 1933 in Iceland (beer was still prohibited until 1989) \n* 1916 to 1927 in Norway (fortified wine and beer were also prohibited from 1917 to 1923)\n* 1919 in the Hungarian Soviet Republic, March 21 to August 1; called szesztilalom\n* 1919 to 1932 in Finland (called kieltolaki, \"ban law\")\n* 1920 to 1933 in the United States\n\nAfter several years, prohibition failed in North America and elsewhere.  Rum-running became widespread and organized crime took control of the distribution of alcohol.  Distilleries and breweries in Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or illegally exported to the United States.  Chicago became notorious as a haven for prohibition dodgers during the time known as the Roaring Twenties.  Prohibition generally came to an end in the late 1920s or early 1930s in most of North America and Europe, although a few locations continued prohibition for many more years.\n\nIn some countries where the dominant religion forbids the use of alcohol, the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited or restricted today.  For example, in Saudi Arabia and Libya alcohol is banned; in Pakistan and Iran it is illegal with exceptions. \n\nAsia\n\nAfghanistan\n\nSale of alcohol is banned in Afghanistan.\n\nBangladesh\n\nIn Bangladesh, alcohol is generally prohibited due to its proscription in the Islamic faith.  However, the purchase and consumption is allowed for non-Muslims in the country.  The Garo tribe consume a type of rice beer, and Christians drink and purchase wine for their holy communion.\n\nBrunei\n\nIn Brunei, alcohol consumption in public and sale of alcohol is banned. Non-Muslims are allowed to purchase a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarkation overseas for their own private consumption, and non-Muslims who are at least the age of 18 are allowed to bring in not more than two bottles of liquor (about two litres) and twelve cans of beer per person into the country.\n\nIndia\n\n In India alcohol is a state subject and individual states can legislate prohibition, but currently most states do not have prohibition. Prohibition is in force in the states of Gujarat, Bihar and Nagaland, parts of Manipur, and the union territory of Lakshadweep. The state of Kerala has placed some limitations on sale of alcohol. All other States and union territories of India permit the sale of alcohol.\n\nElection days and certain national holidays such as Gandhi Jayanti (birthdate of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) are meant to be dry days when liquor sale is not permitted. The state of Andhra Pradesh had imposed Prohibition under the Chief Ministership of N. T. Rama Rao but this was thereafter lifted. Prohibition was also observed from 1996 to 1998 in Haryana. Some Indian states observe dry days on major religious festivals/occasions depending on the popularity of the festival in that region.\n\nIran\n\nSince the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the sale and consumption of alcohol is banned in Iran.\n\nIndonesia\n\nAlcohol is banned for people who use small shops and convenience stores. \n\nKuwait\n\nThe consumption, importation and brewing of, and trafficking in liquor is strictly against the law. \n\nMalaysia\n\nAlcohol is banned for Muslims in Malaysia due to its Islamic faith and sharia law. \n\nMaldives\n\nThe Maldives ban the import of alcohol, x-raying all baggage on arrival. Alcoholic beverages are available only to foreign tourists on resort islands and may not be taken off the resort.\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan allowed the free sale and consumption of alcohol for three decades from 1947, but restrictions were introduced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto just weeks before he was removed as prime minister in 1977. Since then, only members of non-Muslim minorities such as Hindus, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to apply for alcohol permits. The monthly quota is dependent upon one's income, but usually is about five bottles of liquor or 100 bottles of beer. In a country of 180 million, only about 60 outlets are allowed to sell alcohol. The Murree Brewery in Rawalpindi was once the only legal brewery, but today there are more. The ban officially is enforced by the country's Islamic Ideology Council, but it is not strictly policed. Members of religious minorities, however, often sell their liquor permits to Muslims as part of a continuing black market trade in alcohol. \n\nPhilippines\n\nThere are only restrictions during elections in the Philippines. Alcohol is prohibited to be bought two days prior to an election. The Commission on Elections may opt to extend the period of time of the liquor ban. In the 2010 elections, the liquor ban was on a minimum two days; in the 2013 elections, there was a proposal that it be extended to five days.  This was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nOther than election-related prohibition, alcohol is freely sold to anyone above the legal drinking age.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nThe sale, consumption, importation and brewing of, and trafficking in liquor is strictly against the law. \n\nThailand\n\nAlcohol is prohibited from being sold during election time, from 6pm the day prior to voting, until the end of the day of voting itself.  Alcohol is also prohibited on major Buddhist holy days, and sometimes on Royal Commemoration days, such as birthdays.\n\nThailand also enforces time-limited bans on alcohol on a daily basis. Alcohol can only be legally purchased in stores or restaurants between 11am-2pm and 5pm-midnight. This law is enforced by all major retailers (most notably 7-Eleven) and restaurants but is frequently ignored by the smaller 'mom and pop' stores. Hotels and resorts are exempt from the rules.\n\nThe consumption of alcohol is also banned at any time within 200 meters of a filling station (where sale of alcohol is also illegal), schools, temples or hospitals as well as on board any type of road vehicle regardless of whether it is being consumed by the driver or passenger.\n\nAt certain times of the year -- Thai New Year (Songkran) as an example -- the government may also enforce arbitrary bans on the sale and consumption of alcohol in specific public areas where large scale festivities are due to take place and large crowds are expected.\n\nYemen\n\nAlcohol is banned in Yemen.\n\nEurope\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOn 14 September 2012, the government of the Czech Republic banned all sales of liquor with more than 20% alcohol. From this date on it was illegal to sell such alcoholic beverages in shops, supermarkets, bars, restaurants, gas stations, e-shops etc. This measure was taken in response to the wave of methanol poisoning cases resulting in the deaths of 18 people in the Czech Republic.  Since the beginning of the \"methanol affair\" the total number of deaths has increased to 25.  The ban was to be valid until further notice,  though restrictions were eased towards the end of September.  The last bans on Czech alcohol with regard to the poisoning cases were lifted on 10 October 2012, when neighbouring Slovakia and Poland allowed its import once again. \n\nNordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries, with the exception of Denmark, have had a strong temperance movement since the late 1800s, closely linked to the Christian revival movement of the late 19th century, but also to several worker organisations. As an example, in 1910 the temperance organisations in Sweden had some 330,000 members,  which was about 16% of a population of 5.5 million.  Naturally, this heavily influenced the decisions of Nordic politicians in the early 20th century. \n\nAlready in 1907, the Faroe Islands passed a law prohibiting all sale of alcohol, which was in force until 1992. However, very restricted private importation from Denmark was allowed from 1928.\n\nIn 1914, Sweden put in place a rationing system, the Bratt System, in force until 1955. However a referendum in 1922 rejected an attempt to enforce total prohibition.\n\nIn 1915, Iceland instituted total prohibition. The ban for wine and spirits was lifted in 1935, but beer remained prohibited until 1989.\n\nIn 1916, Norway prohibited distilled beverages, and in 1917 the prohibition was extended to also include fortified wine and beer. The wine and beer ban was lifted in 1923, and in 1927 the ban of distilled beverages was also lifted.\n\nIn 1919, Finland enacted prohibition, as one of the first acts after independence from the Russian Empire. Four previous attempts to institute prohibition in the early 20th century had failed due to opposition from the tsar. After a development similar to the one in the United States during its prohibition, with large-scale smuggling and increasing violence and crime rates, public opinion turned against the prohibition, and after a national referendum where 70% voted for a repeal of the law, prohibition was ended in early 1932.  \n\nToday, all Nordic countries (with the exception of Denmark) continue to have strict controls on the sale of alcohol which is highly taxed (dutied) to the public. There are government monopolies in place for selling spirits, wine and stronger beers in Norway (Vinmonopolet), Sweden (Systembolaget), Iceland (V\u00ednb\u00fa\u00f0in), the Faroe Islands (R\u00fasdrekkas\u00f8la Landsins) and Finland (Alko). Bars and restaurants may, however, import alcoholic beverages directly or through other companies.\n\nGreenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, does not share its easier controls on the sale of alcohol.  Greenland has (like Denmark) sales in food shops, but prices are high. Private import when traveling from Denmark is only allowed in small quantities.\n\nRussian Empire and Soviet Union\n\nIn the Russian Empire, a limited version of a Dry Law was introduced in 1914.  It continued through the turmoil of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War into the period of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union until 1925.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAlthough the sale or consumption of commercial alcohol has never been prohibited by law, historically various groups in the UK have campaigned for the prohibition of alcohol, including the Society of Friends (Quakers), The Methodist Church and other non-conformists, as well as temperance movements such as Band of Hope and temperance Chartist movements of the 19th century.\n\nFormed in 1853 and inspired by the Maine law in the USA, the United Kingdom Alliance aimed at promoting a similar law prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the UK. This hard-line group of prohibitionists was opposed by other temperance organisations who preferred moral persuasion to a legal ban. This division in the ranks limited the effectiveness of the temperance movement as a whole. The impotence of legislation in this field was demonstrated when the Sale of Beer Act 1854 which restricted Sunday opening hours had to be repealed, following widespread rioting. In 1859 a prototype prohibition bill was overwhelmingly defeated in the House of Commons. \n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in the Irish state on Christmas Day, and Good Friday. \nFurthermore, licensing hours in supermarkets and off-licences are between 10:30 and 22:00 daily.\n\nNorth America\n\nCanada\n\nAn official, but non-binding, federal referendum on prohibition was held in 1898. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier's government chose not to introduce a federal bill on prohibition, mindful of the strong antipathy in Quebec. As a result, Canadian prohibition was instead enacted through laws passed by the provinces during the first twenty years of the 20th century. The provinces repealed their prohibition laws, mostly during the 1920s.\n\nMexico\n\nZapatista Communities often ban alcohol as part of a collective decision. This has been used by many villages as a way to decrease domestic violence and has generally been favored by women.  However, this is not recognized by federal Mexican law as the Zapatista movement is strongly opposed by the federal government.\n\nThe sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited on and the night before certain national holidays, such as Natalicio de Benito Ju\u00e1rez (birthdate of Benito Ju\u00e1rez) and D\u00eda de la Revoluci\u00f3n, which are meant to be dry nationally. The same \"dry law\" applies to the days before presidential elections every six years.\n\nUnited States\n\nProhibition focused on the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages; however, exceptions were made for medicinal and religious uses. Alcohol consumption was never illegal under federal law. Nationwide Prohibition did not begin in the United States until January 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution went into effect, and was repealed in December, 1933, with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment.  \n \nConcern over excessive alcohol consumption began during the American colonial era, when fines were imposed for drunken behavior and for selling liquor without a license. In the eighteenth century, when drinking was a part of everyday American life, Protestant religious groups, especially the Methodists, and health reformers, including Benjamin Rush and others, urged Americans to curb their drinking habits for moral and health reasons. In particular, Benjamin Rush believed Americans were drinking hard spirits in excess, so he created \"A Moral and Physical Thermometer,\" displaying the progression of behaviors caused by the consumption of various alcohols. By the 1840s the temperance movement was actively encouraging individuals to reduce alcohol consumption. Music (a completely new genre) was composed and performed in support of the efforts, both in social contexts and in response to state legislation attempts to regulate alcohol. Many took a pledge of total abstinence (teetotalism) from drinking distilled liquor as well as beer and wine. Prohibition remained a major reform movement from the 1840s until the 1920s, when nationwide prohibition went into effect, and was supported by evangelical Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, and Congregationalists. Kansas and Maine were early adopters of statewide prohibition. Following passage of the Maine law, Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New York, among others, soon passed statewide prohibition legislation; however, a number of these laws were overturned.\n\nAs temperance groups continued to promote prohibition, other groups opposed increased alcohol restrictions. For example, Chicago's citizens fought against enforcing Sunday closings laws in the 1850s, which included mob violence. It was also during this time when patent medicines, many of which contained alcohol, gained popularity. During the American Civil War efforts at increasing federal revenue included imposition of taxes on liquor and beer. The liquor industry responded to the taxes by forming an industry lobby, the United States Brewers Association, that succeeded in reducing the tax rate on beer from $1 to 60 cents. The Women's Crusade of 1873 and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874, \"marked the formal entrance of women into the temperance movement.\" It was also the first time that women had organized and acted together politically, using their influence to fight against the drunken culture of the time. Organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Movement would set the stage for women to organize and demand political action as a group with common interests and common goals.  The WCTU and the Prohibition Party, organized in 1869, remained major players in the temperance movement until the early twentieth century, when the Anti-Saloon League, formed in 1895, emerged as the movement's leader.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1890, although several states enacted local option laws that allowed counties or towns to go dry by referendum, only six states had statewide prohibition by state statute or constitutional amendment. The League, with the support of evangelical Protestant churches including the Episcopalians and Lutherans, and other Progressive-era reformers continued to press for prohibition legislation. Opposition to prohibition was strong in America's urban industrial centers, where a large, immigrant, working-class population generally opposed it, as did Jewish and Catholic religious groups. In the years leading up to World War I, nativism, American patriotism, distrust of immigrants, and anti-German sentiment became associated with the prohibition movement. Through the use of pressure politics on legislators, the League and other temperance reformers achieved the goal of nationwide prohibition by emphasizing the need to destroy the moral corruption of the saloons and the political power of the brewing industry, and to reduce domestic violence in the home. By 1913 nine states had stateside prohibition and thirty-one others had local option laws in effect, which included nearly fifty percent of the U.S. population. At that time the League and other reformers turned their efforts toward attaining a constitutional amendment and grassroots support for nationwide prohibition.\n\nIn December 1917, after two previous attempts had failed (one in 1913; the other in 1915), Congress approved a resolution to submit a constitutional amendment on nationwide prohibition to the states for ratification.  The new constitutional amendment prohibited \"the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes\".  On January 8, 1918, Mississippi became the first state to ratify the amendment, and on January 16, 1919, Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify it, assuring its passage into federal law. On October 28, 1919, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, which provided enabling legislation to implement the Eighteenth Amendment.  When the National Prohibition Act was passed on October 28, 1919, thirty-three of the forty-eight states were already dry. Congress ratified the Eighteenth Amendment on January 16, 1920, and nationwide prohibition began on January 17, 1920.\n\nDuring the first years of Prohibition, the new federal law was enforced in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and in small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of the Prohibition and once it was passed they helped with the enforcement of it.  For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code.  The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed.  Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.\n\nProhibition became increasingly unpopular during the Great Depression. Some believe that the demand for increased employment and tax revenues during this time brought an end to Prohibition. Others argue it was the result of the economic motivations of American businessmen as well as the stress and excesses of the era that kept it from surviving, even under optimal economic conditions.\n\nRepeal\n\nThe repeal movement was initiated and financed by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment, who worked to elect Congressmen who agreed to support repeal. The group's wealthy supporters included John D. Rockefeller, Jr., S. S. Kresge, and the Du Pont family, among others, who had abandoned the dry cause. Pauline Sabin, a wealthy Republican who founded the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), argued that Prohibition should be repealed because it made the United States a nation of hypocrites and undermined its respect for the rule of law. This hypocrisy and the fact that women had initially led the prohibition movement convinced Sabin to establish the WONPR. Their efforts eventually led to the repeal of prohibition.  \n\nWhen Sabin's fellow Republicans would not support her efforts, she went to the Democrats, who switched their support of the dry cause to endorse repeal under the leadership of liberal politicians such as Fiorello La Guardia and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.\n\nRepeal of Prohibition was accomplished with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5, 1933. Under its terms, states were allowed to set their own laws for the control of alcohol. Following repeal, public interest in an organized prohibition movement dwindled. However, it survived for a while in a few southern and border states. To this day, however, there are still counties and parishes within the US known as \"dry\", where the sale of liquor (whiskey, wine) -not beer- is prohibited; several such municipalities have adopted liquor-by-the-drink, however in order to expand tax revenue. \n\nAl Capone\n\nAl Capone was the most notorious gangster of his generation. Born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York; Capone settled in Chicago to take over Johnny Torrio's business dealing with outlawed liquor. Within three years, Capone had nearly 700 men at his disposal. As the profits came in, Capone acquired finesse\u2014particularly in the management of politicians. By the middle of the decade, he had gained control of the suburb of Cicero, and had installed his own mayor. Capone's rise to fame did not come without bloodshed. Rival gangs, such as the Gennas and the Aiellos, started wars with Capone, eventually leading to a rash of killings of  proportions. In 1927, Capone and his gang were pulling in approximately $60 million per year- most of it from beer. Capone not only controlled the sale of liquor to over 10,000 speakeasies, but he also controlled the supply from Canada to Florida. Capone was imprisoned for tax violations and died January 25, 1947, from a heart attack, pneumonia, and syphilis. \n\nSouth America\n\nVenezuela\n\nIn Venezuela, twenty-one hours before every election, the government prohibits the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages throughout the national territory, including the restriction to all dealers, liquor stores, supermarkets, restaurants, wineries, pubs, bars, public entertainment, clubs and any establishment that markets alcoholic beverages.  This is done to prevent violent alcohol induced confrontations because of the high political polarization. The same is done during the holy week as a measure to reduce the alarming rate of road traffic accidents during these holidays. \n\nOceania\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory (then the Federal Capital Territory) was the first jurisdiction in Australia to have prohibition laws. In 1911, King O'Malley, then Minister of Home Affairs, shepherded laws through Parliament preventing new issue or transfer of licences to sell alcohol, to address unruly behaviour among workers building the new capital city. Prohibition was partial, since possession of alcohol purchased outside of the Territory remained legal and the few pubs that had existing licences could continue to operate. The Federal Parliament repealed the laws after residents of the Federal Capital Territory voted for the end of them in a 1928 plebiscite. \n\nSince then, some local councils have enacted local dry zones in which possession or consumption of alcohol is forbidden.  Nearly all dry zones are only a district within a larger community. Notable among those remaining in existence is the Adelaide city centre.   \n\nMore recently, alcohol has been prohibited in many remote indigenous communities. Penalties for transporting alcohol into these \"dry\" communities are severe and can result in confiscation of any vehicles involved; in dry areas within the Northern Territory, all vehicles used to transport alcohol are seized.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nIn New Zealand, prohibition was a moralistic reform movement begun in the mid-1880s by the Protestant evangelical and Nonconformist churches and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and after 1890 by the Prohibition League. It assumed that individual virtue was all that was needed to carry the colony forward from a pioneering society to a more mature one, but it never achieved its goal of national prohibition. However, both the Church of England and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an intrusion of government into the church's domain, while the growing labor movement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy.  \n\nReformers hoped that the women's vote, in which New Zealand was a pioneer, would swing the balance, but the women were not as well organized as in other countries. Prohibition had a majority in a national referendum in 1911, but needed a 60% vote to pass. The movement kept trying in the 1920s, losing three more referenda by close votes; it managed to keep in place a 6pm closing hour for pubs and Sunday closing. The Depression and war years effectively ended the movement. but their 6pm closing hour remained until October 1967 when it was extended to 10pm.\n\nFor many years, referenda were held for individual towns or electorates, often coincident with general elections. The ballots determined whether these individual areas would be \"dry\" - that is, alcohol could not be purchased or consumed in public in these areas. One notable example was the southern city of Invercargill, which was dry from 1907 to 1943. People wanting alcohol usually travelled to places outside the city (such as the nearby township of Lorneville or the town of Winton) to drink in the local pubs or purchase alcohol to take back home. The last bastion of this 'dry' area remains in force in the form of a licensing trust which still to this day governs the sale of liquor in Invercargill. The city does not allow the sale of alcohol (beer and wine included) in supermarkets unlike the remainder of new Zealand, and all form of alcohol regardless of the sort can only be sold in bars and liquor stores.\n\nProhibition was of limited success in New Zealand as \u2014 like in other countries \u2014 it led to organised bootlegging. The most famous bootlegged alcohol in New Zealand was that produced in the Hokonui Hills close to the town of Gore (not coincidentally, the nearest large town to Invercargill). Even today, the term \"Hokonui\" conjures up images of illicit whisky to many New Zealanders. \n\nElections\n\nIn many countries in Latin America, the Philippines, Turkey and several US states, the sale but not the consumption of alcohol is prohibited before and during elections.",

                "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis, Lady Haden-Guest (born November 22, 1958) is an American actress and author. She made her film debut in 1978 by starring as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). A big hit, the film established her as a notable actress in horror, and she subsequently starred in Halloween II (1981), The Fog (1980), Prom Night (1980), Terror Train (1980), and Roadgames (1981), gaining the status of \"scream queen\" to mainstream audiences. Curtis has since compiled a body of work that spans many genres, including the cult comedy films Trading Places (1983), for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, A Fish Called Wanda (1988), and True Lies (1994), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy.\n\nCurtis' other notable films include Blue Steel (1989) and Freaky Friday (2003), for which she received her third Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy. For her role in the television series Anything But Love, Curtis received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy. Curtis received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress \u2013 Miniseries or a Movie for her performance in the television film, Nicholas' Gift (1998). Curtis currently stars in the comedy horror series Scream Queens on FOX.\n\nCurtis is the daughter of the actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis. She is married to actor, screenwriter, and director Christopher Guest, 5th Baron Haden-Guest. Her 1998 book Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day made the best-seller list in The New York Times. She has appeared in advertisements and is a blogger for The Huffington Post.\n\nEarly life\n\nCurtis was born in Santa Monica, California, to actor Tony Curtis and actress Janet Leigh. Her paternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants  and two of her maternal great-grandparents were Danish.  Curtis's parents divorced in 1962, after which her mother married Robert Brandt. Curtis has an older sister, Kelly Curtis, who is also an actress, and several half-siblings (all from her father's remarriages), Alexandra, Allegra, Benjamin, and Nicholas Curtis (who died in 1994 of a drug overdose).  Curtis attended Westlake School (now Harvard-Westlake School) in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills High School, and graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall. Returning to California in 1976, she attended the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She considered majoring in social work, but quit after one semester to pursue an acting career.\n\nCareer\n\nFilm\n\nCurtis's film debut occurred in the 1978 horror film Halloween, in which she played the role of Laurie Strode. The film was a major success and was considered the highest grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. Curtis was subsequently cast in several horror films, garnering her the title, \"scream queen\".\n\nHer next film was the horror film The Fog, which was helmed by Halloween director John Carpenter. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office,  starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. Her next film, Prom Night, was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to Halloween, yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular \"slasher film\" genre. That year, Curtis also starred in Terror Train, which opened in October and was met with negative reviews akin to Prom Night. Both films performed moderately well at the box office. \n\n Curtis had a similar function in both films - the main character whose friends are murdered, and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who had given negative reviews to all three of Curtis's 1980 films, said that Curtis \"is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one-or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s\".  Curtis later appeared in Halloween II, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Halloween: Resurrection, as well as giving an uncredited voice role in Halloween III: Season of the Witch.\n\nHer role in 1983's Trading Places helped Curtis shed her horror queen image, and garnered her a BAFTA award as best supporting actress.  1988's A Fish Called Wanda achieved near cult status \u2013 while showcasing her as a comedic actress; she was nominated for a BAFTA as best leading actress. She won a Golden Globe for her work in 1994's True Lies. Her film roles also include Disney's Freaky Friday (2003), opposite Lindsay Lohan, filmed at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, near where Curtis and Guest live with their children. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for this film. \n\nIn October 2006, Curtis told Access Hollywood that she had closed the book on her acting career to focus on her family. She returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney's live-action-animated film, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, co-starring opposite Piper Perabo as one of three live-action characters in the film. She also starred in the 2010 comedy film You Again, opposite Kristen Bell and Sigourney Weaver. \n\nTelevision\n\nCurtis made her television debut in an episode of Columbo, but her first starring TV role was opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy Anything But Love, which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. Her performance as Hannah Miller received both a Golden Globe and People's Choice Award. She appeared as nurse Lt. Duran in the short-lived television series, Operation Petticoat; based on the big-screen version which starred her real-life father.\n\nShe starred in the 1981 TV film Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story, playing the role of the eponymous doomed Playmate. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in TNT's adaptation of the Wendy Wasserstein play The Heidi Chronicles. More recently, Curtis starred in the CBS television movie Nicholas' Gift, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Curtis also appeared in the science fiction series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and an early episode of The Drew Carey Show. Jamie Lee Curtis was a game-show panelist on several episodes of Match Game.\n\nIn 2012, she appeared in 5 episodes of the television series NCIS, playing the role of Dr. Samantha Ryan, a potential romantic interest of Special Agent Gibbs (Mark Harmon). It has been hinted that her role may be a recurring one. During an interview, she openly said that if they could develop a story line, she would be more than happy to be on the show more.  It was at least the second time Harmon has worked with Curtis; he played her character's fianc\u00e9 and later husband in the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday. \n\nChildren's books\n\nWorking with illustrator Laura Cornell, Curtis has written a number of children's books,  all published by HarperCollins Children's Books. \n*When I Was Little: A Four-Year Old's Memoir of Her Youth, 1993.\n*Tell Me Again About The Night I was Born, 1996.\n* Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day, 1998; listed on the New York Times best-seller list for 10 weeks. \n*Where Do Balloons Go?: An Uplifting Mystery, 2000.\n*I'm Gonna Like Me: Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem, 2002.\n*It's Hard to Be Five: Learning How to Work My Control Panel, 2004.\n*Is There Really a Human Race?, 2006.\n*Big Words for Little People, ISBN 978-0-06-112759-5, 2008.\n*My Friend Jay, 2009, edition of one, presented to Jay Leno\n*My Mommy Hung the Moon: A Love Story, 2010.\n\nInvention\n\nIn 1987, Curtis filed a US patent application that subsequently issued as Patent No. 4,753,647. This is a modification of a diaper with a moisture proof pocket containing wipes that can be taken out and used with one hand.  Curtis refused to allow her invention to be marketed until companies started selling biodegradable diapers,  although the full statutory term of this patent expired February 20, 2007, and is now in the public domain.\n\nHumanitarian and political causes\n\nIn March 2012, Curtis was featured with Martin Sheen and Brad Pitt in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play '8' \u2014 a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 as Sandy Stier.  The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.   In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Curtis and others told the stories of the people killed there.  \n\nPhilanthropic efforts\n\nCurtis is a staunch supporter of children's hospitals and their advocacy efforts. Currently, she plays a leadership role for Children's Hospital Los Angeles and supported the 2011 opening of a new inpatient facility for the organization. During California's 2008 general election, Curtis appeared in the \"YES on Prop 3\" TV advertisements. \n\nCurtis was guest of honor at the 11th annual gala and fundraiser in 2003 for Women in Recovery, a Venice, California-based non-profit organization offering a live-in, twelve-step program of rehabilitation for women in need. Past honorees of this organization include Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Angela Lansbury. Curtis is also involved in the work of the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation, serving as the annual host for the organization's \"Dream Halloween\" event in Los Angeles, launched every year in October.  \n\nPersonal life\n\nCurtis married actor Christopher Guest on December 18, 1984, becoming the Lady Haden-Guest when her husband inherited the Barony of Haden-Guest in 1996, upon the death of his father.  She originally fell in love when she saw a picture of him from the movie This Is Spinal Tap in Rolling Stone saying to her friend Debra Hill \"Oh, I'm going to marry that guy\", actually marrying him five months later.  The couple have two adopted children (Annie, b. 1986; Thomas b. 1996).  Curtis is actor Jake Gyllenhaal's godmother. \n\nShe is close friends with actress Sigourney Weaver. In a 2015 interview, she admitted that she has never watched Weaver's film, Alien, in its entirety because she was too scared. \n\nOn her website, Curtis tells her young readers that she \"moonlights as an actor, photographer, and closet organizer.\" She takes time to support various philanthropic groups. Curtis appeared on the cover of the May/June 2008 issue of AARP Magazine, with gray hair and in water up to her chest. \n\nCurtis is a recovering alcoholic, and was once addicted to pain killers that she began using after a routine cosmetic surgical procedure. She became sober in 1999  and maintains that recovery is the greatest achievement of her life. \n\nCurtis has appeared in advertisements for Activia since 2007,  and is a blogger for The Huffington Post online newspaper. \n\nShe is a fan of World of Warcraft,  and has attended ComicCon  and BlizzCon  incognito. She once helped her son Thomas create a cosplay of blood elf character Kael'thas Sunstrider, which he entered into a BlizzCon costume contest. Together they also got the chance to attend the premier of the Warcraft film on June 6, 2016, at The Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. \n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nTelevision",

                "title": "Kathleen Ferrier",
                "text": "Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 - 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.  \n\nThe daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout England. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.\n\nFerrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954.  The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\n\nThe Ferrier family originally came from Pembrokeshire in South West Wales. The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century, when Thomas Ferrier (youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment) settled in the area after being stationed near Blackburn during a period of industrial unrest.Cardus, pp. 19\u201320 Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912, in the Lancashire village of Higher Walton where her father William Ferrier (the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Gorton) was the head of the village school. Although untrained musically, William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs, and his wife Alice (n\u00e9e Murray), whom he married in 1900, was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice.Ferrier, pp. 14\u201316 Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple's children, following a sister and a brother; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn, after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul's School in the town. From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist, and had lessons with Frances Walker, a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of Tobias Matthay. Kathleen's talent developed quickly; in 1924 she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the Lytham St Annes Festival piano competition, and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place. \n\nTelephonist and pianist\n\nBecause of William's impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn.  She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize.  On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall.  After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist. \n\nIn 1931, aged 19, Ferrier passed her Licentiate examinations at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small mezzo-soprano role in a church performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George's Hall and elsewhere.Leonard, pp. 19\u201320 Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, to be close to her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson.  While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new \"speaking clock\" service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London.   Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women.  Of Ferrier's career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: \"For more than a decade, when she should have been studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing.\" \n\nMarriage\n\nFerrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, probably through dancing, which they both loved. When she announced that they were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated.Leonard, pp. 26\u201328 In a tribute article written for the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death, the journalist Rupert Christiansen wrote of Ferrier's sexuality that \"there is absolutely no justification for the idea that she was a lesbian, but she may have been sexually frigid\". Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969. \n\nEarly singing career\n\nIn 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival. \n\nAfter her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria.  She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby  in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast\u2014her first as a vocalist\u2014attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. Ferrier, pp. 39\u201340 At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Soul's Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar. \n\nWhen Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano.  However, her application to the BBC's head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down.Fifield (ed.), p. 17  Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hall\u00e9 concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed to hear her sing, and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett, the London-based concert management agency.  John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent's advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942 she moved with her sister Winifred into an apartment in Frognal Mansions, Hampstead.  \n\nStardom\n\nGrowing reputation\n\nFerrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess.Leonard, pp. 50\u201351 Although she wrote \"went off very well\" in her diary,  Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \"warm and spacious tone\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\".  However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\". \n\nOn 17 May 1943 Ferrier sang in Handel's Messiah at Westminster Abbey, alongside Isobel Baillie and Peter Pears, with Reginald Jacques conducting.   According to the critic Neville Cardus, it was through the quality of her singing here that Ferrier \"made her first serious appeal to musicians\".  Her assured performance led to other important engagements, and to broadcasting work; her increasingly frequent appearances on popular programmes such as Forces Favourites and Housewives' Choice soon gave her national recognition. In May 1944, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios with Gerald Moore as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, Gluck and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the Columbia label; it consisted of two songs by Maurice Greene, again with Moore accompanying.  Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, Walter Legge, and after a few months she transferred to Decca. \n\nIn the remaining wartime months Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar's choral work The Dream of Gerontius, her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles.  In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece, Sea Pictures; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates.  On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms, when she sang L'Air des Adieux from Tchaikovsky's opera The Maid of Orleans.   Although she often sang individual arias, opera was not Ferrier's natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet's Carmen at Stourbridge in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements.  Nevertheless, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey Messiah performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera The Rape of Lucretia, which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would share the part with Nancy Evans.Britten, pp. 83\u201385 Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was \"enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it's the best part one could possibly have\". \n\nFerrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received.  On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. \nBy contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance.  This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\"  Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che far\u00f2 (\"What is life\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise. \n\nFerrier's association with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when Rudolf Bing, the festival's general manager, recommended her to Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist in a performance of Mahler's symphonic song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. This was planned for the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; \"I recognised with delight that here potentially was one of the greatest singers of our time\", he later wrote.  Das Lied von der Erde was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the Edinburgh Evening News thought it \"simply superb\".  In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, Lord Harewood described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer's final illness, as \"a rare match of music, voice, and temperament.\" \n\nCareer apex, 1948\u201351\n\nOn 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\".  After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February. \n\nDuring 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour.  This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics.  On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arp\u00e1d S\u00e1ndor (1896\u20131972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \"this abominable accompanist\" who deserved \"a kick in the pants\".  When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\".  Eventually, when S\u00e1ndor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship. \n\nShortly after her return to England early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in the world premiere of Britten's Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Britten had written this work specifically for her.  At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented \"a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years\".  A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: \"Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best\". \n\nThe following 18 months saw almost uninterrupted activity, encompassing a number of visits to continental Europe and a third American tour between December 1949 and April 1950. This American trip broke new ground for Ferrier\u2014the West Coast\u2014and included three performances in San Francisco of Orfeo ed Euridice, with Pierre Monteux conducting. At the rehearsals Ferrier met the renowned American contralto Marian Anderson, who reportedly said of her English counterpart: \"My God, what a voice\u2014and what a face!\"  On Ferrier's return home the hectic pace continued, with a rapid succession of concerts in Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh followed by a tour of Austria, Switzerland and Italy.  In Vienna, the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was Ferrier's co-soloist in a recorded performance of Bach's Mass in B minor, with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan. Schwarzkopf later recalled Ferrier's singing of the Agnus Dei from the Mass as her highlight of the year. \n\nEarly in 1951, while on tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father's death at the age of 83.  Although she was upset by this news, she decided to continue with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: \"My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke\".  She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hall\u00e9 a work that was new to her: Ernest Chausson's Po\u00e8me de l'amour et de la mer. This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim.  Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at University College Hospital, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a mastectomy was performed on 10 April.  All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of The Rape of Lucretia by the English Opera Group, scheduled as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain. \n\nLater career\n\nFailing health\n\nFerrier resumed her career on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the Royal Albert Hall. She then made her usual visit to the Holland Festival, where she gave four performances of Orfeo, and sang in Mahler's Second Symphony with Otto Klemperer and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson's Po\u00e8me with Barbirolli and the Hall\u00e9.  In November she sang Land of Hope and Glory at the reopening of Manchester's Free Trade Hall, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, \"moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears\".  After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent radiation therapy; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios. \n\nIn January 1952 Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a short series of concerts to raise funds for Britten's English Opera Group. Writing later, Britten recalled this tour as \"perhaps the loveliest of all\" of his artistic associations with Ferrier.  Despite continuing health problems, she sang in the St Matthew Passion at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, Messiah at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and Das Lied von der Erde with Barbirolli and the Hall\u00e9 on 23 and 24 April.Fifield (ed.), p. 296 On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, Elizabeth\u00a0II, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: \"Princess M sang\u2014very good!\". Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of androgen injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice.  In May she travelled to Vienna to record Das Lied and Mahler's R\u00fcckert-Lieder with Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.  \n\nDuring the remainder of 1952 Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of Das Lied, The Dream of Gerontius, Messiah and some Brahms songs.  She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in October.  In November, after a Royal Festival Hall recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing \"distracting extra vocal appeals\" designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs.  However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that \"...\u00a0it's hard to please everybody\u2014for years I've been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer\".  In December she sang in the BBC's Christmas Messiah, the last time she would perform this work. On New Year's Day 1953 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's New Year Honours List. \n\nFinal performances, illness and death\n\nAs 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for Orpheus, an English-language version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously.  Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra.  During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.  \n\nThe first Orpheus performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic's comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage.  However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left femur partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital.  This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled.  Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier's incapacity; an announcement in The Guardian stated: \"Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in Orpheus\". \n\nFerrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend.  Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions.  She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate.Leonard, pp. 241\u201345 Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914.  In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this \"unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better\".  This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself.  As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival.  Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service.Leonard, pp. 246\u201351 She left an estate worth \u00a315,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was \"not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day\". \n\nAssessment and legacy\n\nThe news of Ferrier's death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that \"no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered\". Her death, he continued, \"quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation\" (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she \"may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen.\"  Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: \"The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler\u2014in that order.\"  Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, \"have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague.\" At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: \"She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world.\"\n\nFrom time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier's career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brang\u00e4ne in Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival. According to Christiansen she would have been \"glorious\" in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the Ring cycle.  Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: \"We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing\u2014contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos\". However, she was \"a singer of, and for, her time\u2014a time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility\". In this context \"her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere\".\n\nShortly after Ferrier's death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.  \n\nAs the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year's study to a single prizewinner.   With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel.  The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer's life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain's major music colleges.  The Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier's birth in 2012.  In February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the \"Britons of Distinction\" stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius. \n\nA biographic documentary film,  Kathleen Ferrier, also known as ' was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by ARTE France in 2012.  It featured interviews with her near relatives, friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts.   Kathleen Ferrier Crescent, in Basildon, Essex, is named in her honour. \n\nRecordings\n\nFerrier's discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs.  The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th-century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her St John Passion was captured on disc. \n\nThe recording of the unaccompanied  Northumbrian folk song \"Blow the Wind Southerly\", initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio  in shows such as Desert Island Discs, Housewives' Choice and Your Hundred Best Tunes.   Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is \"What is life?\" (Che far\u00f2) from   Orfeo ed Euridice.  These records sold in large numbers rivalling those of other stars of the time, such as Frank Sinatra and Vera Lynn. In the 21st century Ferrier's  recordings still sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year.  \n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*",

                "title": "Arthur Balfour",
                "text": "Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour,  (;  25 July 1848 \u2013 19 March 1930) was a British Conservative politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from July 1902 to December 1905, and later Foreign Secretary.\n\nEntering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900.\n\nIn July 1902 he succeeded Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister. He oversaw reform of British defence policy and the Entente Cordiale, an agreement with France that influenced Britain's decision to join the First World War. However, he was seen as an ambivalent personality and a weak Prime Minister.  In 1905 he strongly supported stringent anti-immigration legislation, meant primarily to prevent Jewish immigrants fleeing the pogroms of Eastern Europe from entering the U.K.   He cautiously embraced the imperial preference championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer war (counter-insurgency warfare characterized as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. After re-entering Parliament at a by-election, he continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act. He resigned as party leader later in 1911.\n\nBalfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916 he became Foreign Secretary in David Lloyd George's wartime administration, but was frequently left out of the inner workings of government, although the Balfour Declaration bore his name. He continued to serve in senior Cabinet positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopher \u2013 he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth \u2013 and was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\".\n\nBackground and early career\n\nArthur Balfour was born at Whittingehame House, East Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of James Maitland Balfour (1820\u20131856) and Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil (1825\u20131872). His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather James; his mother, a member of the Cecil family descended from Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was the daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and a sister to the 3rd Marquess, the future Prime Minister. His godfather was the Duke of Wellington, after whom he was named.Tuchman, The Proud Tower, p. 46. He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at Grange preparatory school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire (1859\u20131861), and Eton College (1861\u20131866), where he studied with the influential master, William Johnson Cory. He went to the University of Cambridge, where he read moral sciences at Trinity College (1866\u20131869),  graduating with a second-class honours degree. His younger brother was the Cambridge embryologist Francis Maitland Balfour (1851\u20131882).\n\nAlthough he coined the saying \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\", Balfour was distraught at the early death from typhus in 1875 of his cousin May Lyttelton, whom he had hoped to marry: later, mediums claimed to pass on messages from her \u2013 see the \"Palm Sunday Case\".  Balfour remained a bachelor. Margot Tennant (later Margot Asquith) wished to marry him, but Balfour said: \"No, that is not so. I rather think of having a career of my own.\" His household was maintained by his unmarried sister, Alice. In middle age, Balfour had a 40-year friendship with Mary Charteris (n\u00e9e Wyndham), Lady Elcho, later Countess of Wemyss and March.  Although one biographer writes that \"it is difficult to say how far the relationship went\", her letters suggest they may have become lovers in 1887 and may have engaged in sado-masochism,R. J. Q. Adams, Balfour, The Last Grandee, p. 47. a claim echoed by A. N. Wilson. Another biographer believes they had \"no direct physical relationship\", although he dismisses as unlikely suggestions that Balfour was homosexual, or, in view of a time during the Boer War when he replied to a message while drying himself after his bath, Lord Beaverbrook's claim that he was \"a hermaphrodite\" whom no-one saw naked.Mackay, Balfour, Intellectual Statesman, p. 8.\n\nIn 1874 he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertford until 1885. In spring 1878, Balfour became Private Secretary to his uncle, Lord Salisbury. He accompanied Salisbury (then Foreign Secretary) to the Congress of Berlin and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the Russo-Turkish conflict. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his Defence of Philosophic Doubt (1879) suggested he might make a reputation as a philosopher.\n\nBalfour divided his time between politics and academic pursuits. Released from his duties as private secretary by the general election of 1880, he began to take more part in parliamentary affairs. He was for a time politically associated with Lord Randolph Churchill, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff and John Gorst. This quartet became known as the \"Fourth Party\" and gained notoriety for leader Lord Randolph Churchill's free criticism of Sir Stafford Northcote, Lord Cross and other prominent members of the \"old gang\".\n\nService in Lord Salisbury's governments\n\nIn 1885, Lord Salisbury appointed Balfour President of the Local Government Board; the following year he became Secretary for Scotland with a seat in the cabinet. These offices, while offering few opportunities for distinction, were an apprenticeship. In early 1887, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, resigned because of illness and Salisbury appointed his nephew in his place. That surprised the political world and possibly led to the British phrase \"Bob's your uncle!\". Balfour surprised critics by ruthless enforcement of the Crimes Act, earning the nickname \"Bloody Balfour\". His steady administration did much to dispel his reputation as a political lightweight.\n\nIn Parliament he resisted overtures to the Irish Parliamentary Party on Home Rule, and, allied with Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists, encouraged Unionist activism in Ireland. Balfour also helped the poor by creating the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1890. In 1886\u20131892 he became one of the most effective public speakers of the age. Impressive in matter rather than delivery, his speeches were logical and convincing, and delighted an ever wider audience.\n\nOn the death of W.H. Smith in 1891, Balfour became First Lord of the Treasury \u2013 the last in British history not to have been concurrently Prime Minister as well \u2013 and Leader of the House of Commons. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition. When the Conservatives returned to power, in coalition with the Liberal Unionists, in 1895, Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management, yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900.\n\nDuring the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Salisbury's absence abroad, Balfour was in charge of the Foreign Office, and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the Transvaal negotiations in 1899, he bore his share of controversy and, when the war began disastrously, he was first to realise the need to use the country's full military strength. His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nOn Lord Salisbury's resignation on 11 July 1902, Balfour succeeded him as Prime Minister, with the approval of all the Unionist party. The new Prime Minister came into power practically at the same moment as the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the end of the South African War. The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers. The two chief items of the ministerial parliamentary programme were the extension of the new Education Act to London and the Irish Land Purchase Act, by which the British exchequer would advance the money for tenants in Ireland to buy land. An achievement of Balfour's government was establishment of the Committee on Imperial Defence.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Balfour and his Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, improved relations with France, culminating in the Entente cordiale of 1904. The period also saw the Russo-Japanese War, when Britain, an ally of the Japanese, came close to war with Russia after the Dogger Bank incident. On the whole, Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne, being busy himself with domestic problems.\n\nBalfour distrusted the American concept of equality. During negotiations over creation of the League of Nations, the topic of \"all men being created equal\" came up in the context of the American Declaration of Independence. Speaking to Col. Edward M. House an aide to President Woodrow Wilson and David Hunter Miller, chief legal adviser to the US Commission, Balfour said \"that was an 19th century proposition that he didn't believe was true. He believed that it was true that in a sense all men in a particular nation were created equal, but not that a man in Central Africa was created equal to a European.\" \n\nThe budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. Charles Thomson Ritchie's remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to Joseph Chamberlain's crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with trade preference given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks. Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross. Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party, Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British, in the hope of encouraging global free trade.\n\nThis was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government. With Balfour's agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, including Chancellor Ritchie, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour's Cabinet weak. By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders (Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour's act had drained his authority within the government.\n\nBalfour resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905, hoping the Liberal leader Campbell-Bannerman would be unable to form a strong government. This was dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (\"The Relugas Compact\") to \"kick him upstairs\" to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour losing his seat at Manchester East to Thomas Gardner Horridge, a solicitor and king's counsel. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons, at least two-thirds followers of Chamberlain, who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a safe seat in the City of London.\n\nArthur Balfour's Government, July 1902 \u2013 December 1905\n\n*Arthur Balfour \u2013 First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons\n*Lord Halsbury \u2013 Lord Chancellor\n*The Duke of Devonshire \u2013 Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords\n*Aretas Akers-Douglas \u2013 Secretary of State for the Home Department\n*Lord Lansdowne \u2013 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\n*Joseph Chamberlain \u2013 Secretary of State for the Colonies\n*St John Brodrick \u2013 Secretary of State for War\n*Lord George Hamilton \u2013 Secretary of State for India\n*Lord Selborne \u2013 First Lord of the Admiralty\n*Charles Thomson Ritchie \u2013 Chancellor of the Exchequer\n*Gerald Balfour \u2013 President of the Board of Trade\n*Sir William Hood Walrond \u2013 Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n*Lord Balfour of Burleigh \u2013 Secretary for Scotland\n*George Wyndham \u2013 Chief Secretary for Ireland\n*Walter Hume Long \u2013 President of the Local Government Board\n*Robert William Hanbury \u2013 President of the Board of Agriculture\n*Lord Londonderry \u2013 President of the Board of Education\n*Lord Ashbourne \u2013 Lord Chancellor of Ireland\n*Lord Windsor \u2013 First Commissioner of Public Works\n*Austen Chamberlain \u2013 Postmaster-General\nChanges\n*May 1903 \u2013 Lord Onslow succeeds R.W.

An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government, made in Balfour's usual abstruse, theoretical style, saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: \"Enough of this foolery,\" to the delight of his supporters. Balfour made the controversial decision, with Lord Lansdowne, to use the heavily Unionist House of Lords as a check on the political programme and legislation of the Liberal party in the Commons. Legislation was vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading David Lloyd George to remark that the Lords had become \"not the watchdog of the Constitution, but Mr. Balfour's poodle.\" The issue was forced by the Liberals with Lloyd George's People's Budget, provoking the constitutional crisis that led to the Parliament Act 1911, which limited the Lords to delaying bills for up to two years. After the Unionists lost the general elections of 1910 (despite softening the tariff reform policy with Balfour's promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, to prevent mass creation of Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded in late 1911 by Andrew Bonar Law.\n\nBalfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined Asquith's coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. When Asquith's government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour, who seemed a potential successor to the premiership, became Foreign Secretary in Lloyd George's new administration, but not in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of inner workings of government. Balfour's service as Foreign Secretary was notable for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter to Lord Rothschild promising the Jews a \"national home\" in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBalfour resigned as Foreign Secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, but continued in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as Lord President of the Council. In 1921\u201322 he represented the British Empire at the Washington Naval Conference and during summer 1922 stood in for the Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, who was ill. He put proposed for an international settlement of war debts and reparations, called the Balfour Note, but met an unfavourable response.\n\nIn 1922 he, with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George's government following the Conservative back-bench revolt against continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law became Prime Minister. On 5 May 1922, Balfour was created Earl of Balfour and Viscount Thaprain, 'of\nWhittingehame, in the county of Haddington.'  Like many Coalition leaders, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922\u20134, but as an elder statesman, he was consulted by the King in the choice of Baldwin as Bonar Law's successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. When asked whether \"dear George\" (the much more experienced Lord Curzon) would be chosen, he replied, referring to Curzon's wealthy wife Grace, \"No, dear, George will not but he will still have the means of Grace.\"\n\nBalfour was not initially included in Stanley Baldwin's second government in 1924, but in 1925, he returned to the Cabinet, in place of the late Lord Curzon as Lord President of the Council, until the government ended in 1929. In 1925, he visited the Holy Land. \n\nApart from a number of colds and occasional influenza, Balfour had good health until 1928 and remained until then a regular tennis player. Four years, previously he had been the first president of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. At the end of 1928, most of his teeth were removed and he suffered the unremitting circulatory trouble which ended his life. Late in January 1929, Balfour was taken from Whittingehame to Fishers Hill House, his brother Gerald's home near Woking, Surrey. In the past, he had suffered occasional phlebitis and by late 1929 he was immobilised by it. Finally, soon after receiving a visit from his friend Chaim Weizmann, Balfour died at Fishers Hill House on 19 March 1930. At his request a public funeral was declined, and he was buried on 22 March beside members of his family at Whittingehame in a Church of Scotland service although he also belonged to the Church of England. By special remainder, the title passed to his brother Gerald.\n\nHis obituaries in The Times, The Guardian and the Daily Herald did not mention the declaration for which he is most famous outside Britain. \n\nPersonality\n\nBalfour developed a manner known to friends as the Balfourian manner. Harold Begbie, a journalist, in a book called Mirrors of Downing Street, criticised Balfour for his manner, personality and self-obsession. Begbie disagreed with Balfour's political views, but even his one-sided criticisms do not entirely conceal Balfour's shyness and diffidence. The sections of the work dealing with Balfour's personality were:\n\nChurchill compared Balfour to H. H. Asquith: \"The difference between Balfour and Asquith is that Arthur is wicked and moral, while Asquith is good and immoral.\" Balfour said of himself, \"I am more or less happy when being praised, not very comfortable when being abused, but I have moments of uneasiness when being explained.\" \n\nWritings and academic achievements\n\nBalfour is thought to have formulated the basis for the evolutionary argument against naturalism. Balfour argued the Darwinian premise of selection for reproductive fitness cast doubt on scientific naturalism, because human cognitive facilities that would accurately perceive truth could be less advantageous than adaptation for evolutionarily useful illusions. \n\nAs he says:\n\nHe was a member of the Society for Psychical Research, a society studying psychic and paranormal phenomena, and was its president from 1892 to 1894. In 1914, he delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, which formed the basis for the book Theism and Humanism (1915).\n\nArtistic\n\nAfter the First World War, when there was controversy over the style of headstone proposed for use on British war graves being taken on by the Imperial War Graves Commission, Balfour submitted a design for a cruciform headstone. At an exhibition in August 1919, it drew many criticisms; the Commission's principal architect, Sir John Burnet, said Balfour's cross would create a criss-cross effect destroying any sense of \"restful diginity\", Edwin Lutyens called it \"extraordinarily ugly\", and its shape was variously described as resembling a shooting target or bottle. His design was not accepted but the Commission offered him a second chance to submit another design which he did not take up, having been refused once. After a further exhibition in the House of Commons, the \"Balfour cross\" was ultimately rejected in favour of the standard headstone the Commission permanently adopted because the latter offered more space for inscriptions and service emblems.\n\nPopular culture\n\n* Balfour was the subject of two parody novels based on Alice in Wonderland, Clara in Blunderland (1902) and Lost in Blunderland (1903), which appeared under the pseudonym Caroline Lewis; one of the co-authors was Harold Begbie.  \n* The character Arthur Balfour plays a supporting, off-screen role in Upstairs, Downstairs, promoting the family patriarch, Richard Bellamy, to the position of Civil Lord of the Admiralty..\n* Balfour was portrayed by Lyndon Brook in the 1975 ATV production Edward the Seventh.\n* A fictionalised version of Arthur Balfour (identified as \"Mr. Balfour\") appears as British Prime Minister in the science fiction romance The Angel of the Revolution by George Griffith, published in 1893 (when Balfour was still in opposition) but set in an imagined near future of 1903\u20131905.\n* The indecisive Balfour (identified as \"Halfan Halfour\") appears in a satirical short story by Saki in which he, and other leading politicians including Quinston, are changed into animals appropriate to their characters.\n\nLegacy\n\nA portrait of Balfour by Philip de Laszlo is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge. \n\nBalfouria, a Moshav in Israel and many streets in Israel are named after him.\n\nStyles of address\n\n*1848\u20131874: Mr Arthur James Balfour\n*1874\u20131880: Mr Arthur James Balfour MP\n*1880\u20131885: Mr Arthur James Balfour MP DL\n*1885\u20131916: The Right Honourable Arthur James Balfour MP DL\n*1916\u20131922: The Right Honourable Arthur James Balfour OM MP DL\n*1922: The Right Honourable Sir Arthur James Balfour KG OM MP DL\n*1922\u20131930: The Right Honourable The Earl of Balfour KG OM PC DL\n\nHonours and Decorations\n\n* He was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1885, giving him the style \"The Right Honourable\" and after ennoblement the post-nominal letters \"PC\" for life. \n* He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter on 24 February 1922, becoming Sir Arthur Balfour and giving him the post-nominal letters \"KG\" for life.\n* On 5 May 1922, Balfour was raised to the peerage as Earl of Balfour and Viscount Thaprain, of Whittingehame, in the county of Haddington.

                "text": "\"Kiss You All Over\" is a 1978 song performed by the group Exile. It was written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn. It was included on the band's album Mixed Emotions, and it featured Jimmy Stokley and guitarist JP Pennington on lead vocals. It was a number one single in the United States, but proved to be Exile's only big hit in the pop rock market.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 5 song for 1978. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on Mickie Most's RAK Records, and it peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.  In this song, a string synthesizer is used.\n\nLead vocalist on the song Stokley was ousted from the band in 1979, his health declining thereafter until he died at the age of 41 in 1985. The band moved into country music following the synth-pop success of \"Kiss You All Over\" and the 1979 follow-on hit \"You Thrill Me\" (reaching #40 (UK no. 67)) and \"How Could This Go Wrong\", #88 on the charts. \"Take Me Down\" peaked at #3 on the Euro Hit 40 in the mid-1980s.\n\nCover versions\n\n* 1978: A version by Jim Mundy and Terri Melton made number 87 on the Hot Country Songs charts.\n* 1978: A Disco version was covered by Broadway\n* 1979: Along with the track \"So Strange\", Phyllis Hyman covered this song and had a minor disco hit, peaking at number 75.\n* Also in 1979, Millie Jackson covered this song for her album A Moment's Pleasure and it was released as a single in Europe.\n* 1982: A lovers rock version by Samantha Rose produced by reggae producer Winston Curtis was recorded in London.\n* 1993: Tiffany released a version on her Asia-only album Dreams Never Die. The album (and song) were re-released in the U.S. in 2005. \n* 1997: The band No Mercy's remixed version by Johnny Vicious and Darrin \"Spike\" Friedman reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.  It also reached #16 on the UK Singles Chart and #47 in Australia.\n* 2013: On the album Love Will..., Trace Adkins recorded a cover version with Exile (J.P. Pennington and Les Taylor).\n* 2016: A cover of the song appears on the Information Society album Orders of Magnitude\n\nAppearances in other media\n\nThe song was featured in the films Happy Gilmore, Wild Hogs, Man on the Moon, Employee of the Month, and Zookeeper. It was also used in 2007 on CBC's Hockey Night In Canada during a montage of Stanley Cup celebrations at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The song closes out the finale of the first season of the Amazon Series Red Oaks.",

                "title": "Andrew Lloyd Webber",
                "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber   (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre. \n\nSeveral of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 13 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass. Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals, notably \"The Music of the Night\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\" and \"You Must Love Me\" from Evita, \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and \"Memory\" from Cats.\n\nHe has received a number of awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage from Queen Elizabeth II for services to Music, seven Tonys, three Grammys (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, fourteen Ivor Novello Awards, seven Olivier Awards, a Golden Globe, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and the 2008 Classic Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.    He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. \n\nHis company, the Really Useful Group, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of the Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. Lloyd Webber is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, West London. He is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992 he set up the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture and heritage in the UK. \n\nEarly life\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was born in Kensington, London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914\u20131982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921\u20131993), a violinist and pianist.  His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a renowned solo cellist.\n\nLloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age, a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on \"productions\" with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). Later, he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres, including the Palace. His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. He also had originally set music to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats at the age of 15.\n\nIn 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School and studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music and pursue his interest in musical theatre.  \n\nProfessional career\n\nEarly years\n\nLloyd Webber's first collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice was The Likes of Us, a musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. Although composed in 1965, it was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn 1968, Rice and Lloyd Webber were commissioned to write a piece for the Colet Court preparatory school, which resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiche a number of musical styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. This culminated in a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End on the back of the success of Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nIn 1969 Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \"Try It and See,\" which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, Jesus Christ Superstar (1970).\n\nThe planned follow-up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.  After doing some initial work on the lyrics, he pulled out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves (1996). Only two of the songs from the original production remained (\"Half a Moment\" and \"Banjo Boy\").\n\nMid-1970s\n\nLloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write Evita (1978 in London/1979 in U.S.), a musical based on the life of Eva Per\u00f3n. As with Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) and featured Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Per\u00f3n. The song \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role.\n\nPatti LuPone created the role of Eva on Broadway for which she won a Tony.  Evita was a highly successful show that ran for ten years in the West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1979. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita. In an interview in 2011, LuPone commented \"He writes crap music... Evita was his best score, Evita in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought 'I swear to God, he hated women' [...] There are some very romantic moments in his music, and there is some real...trash that he doesn't even think about parting with. He's not a very good editor of his own stuff.\" \n\nIn 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a solo project, the \"Variations\", with his cellist brother Julian based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini, which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV's long-running South Bank Show throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series Whicker's World, which was used from 1978-80.\n\n1980s\n\nLloyd Webber was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the Adelphi Theatre.\n\nLloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. Cats (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing. On Broadway, Cats ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, The Phantom of the Opera. \n\nStarlight Express (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It enjoyed a record run in the West End, but ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. The show also runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988.\n\nLloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival.  Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.\n\nCricket (1986), also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), reunited Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice to create this short musical for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLloyd Webber also premiered The Phantom of the Opera in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd-Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Cats as the longest-running musical on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway.\n\nAspects of Love followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. Aspects had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK.\n\n1990s\n\nLloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and composed \"Amigos Para Siempre\u00a0\u2014 Friends for Life\" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and Jos\u00e9 Carreras.\n\nLloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder's critically acclaimed movie, Sunset Boulevard, since the early 1970s when he saw the film, but the project didn't come to fruition until after the completion of Aspects of Love when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures,  The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on Aspects of Love; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances. In spite of the show's popularity and extensive run in London's West End, it lost money due to the sheer expense of the production.\n\nIn 1994, Sunset Boulevard became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, \"it had not recouped its reported $13\u00a0million investment.\" \nFrom 1995-2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in The Daily Telegraph where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers. \n\nIn 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of \"Cats\", which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and Sir John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.\n\nIn 1998 Whistle Down the Wind made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards, the production is probably most notable for the number-one hit from Boyzone \"No Matter What\" which left only the UK charts when the price of the CD single was changed to drop it out of the official top ten. His The Beautiful Game opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show has been re-worked into a new musical, The Boys in the Photograph, which had its world premi\u00e8re at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.\n\n2000s\n\nHaving achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by The New York Times in 2001 as \"the most commercially successful composer in history.\" \n\nIn 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical Bombay Dreams to London. With music by Bollywood composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, iIt ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances.\n\nOn 16 September 2004, his production of The Woman in White opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.\n\nLloyd Webber produced a staging of The Sound of Music, which d\u00e9buted November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, in which he was a judge.  The winner of the show was Connie Fisher.\n\nIt was announced on 25 August 2006, on his personal website, that his next project would be The Master and Margarita; however, it was announced in late March 2007 that he had abandoned the project. \n\nIn September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named to be a recipient of the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts.[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/home.html The Kennedy Center Honors] He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show Grease: You're the One that I Want!  The contestants all sang \"The Phantom of the Opera\".\n\nBetween April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's Any Dream Will Do!, which followed the same format as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Lee Mead won the contest after quitting his part in the ensemble \u2013 and as understudy in The Phantom of the Opera \u2013 to compete for the role. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than \u00a3500,000 for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.\n\nOn 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.   BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd-Webber musicals on 24 August 2007.  Denise Van Outen introduced songs from Whistle Down the Wind, The Beautiful Game, Tell Me on a Sunday, The Woman in White, Evita  and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat \u2013 as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical Bombay Dreams.\n\nIn April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show I'd Do Anything. The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in an upcoming West End production of the Lionel Bart musical Oliver! The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008. Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show American Idol, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week. \n\nLloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the UK's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called Eurovision: Your Country Needs You, was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with It's My Time, by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished 5th in the contest. The winner was Norway's Alexander Rybak with his world record composition \"Fairytale\".\n\nOn 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical Love Never Dies at a press conference held at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original Phantom has been running since 1986. Also present were Sierra Boggess, who has been cast as Christine Daa\u00e9, and Ramin Karimloo, who portrayed Phantom, a role he most recently played in the West End.\n\n2010s\n\nFollowing the opening of Love Never Dies, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series Over the Rainbow. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of The Wizard of Oz. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\n\nOn 26 February 2010, he appeared on BBC's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross to promote Love Never Dies.\n\nOn 1 March 2011, The Wizard of Oz opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Danielle Hope as Dorothy and Michael Crawford as the Wizard.\n\nIn 2012 Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show Superstar which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an upcoming arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar. The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as King Herod.  Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.\n\nWebber caused controversy with a series of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: \"I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. I saw no black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I think we would have placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good.\" The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.\n\nIn 2013, Webber reunited with Christopher Hampton and Don Black on Stephen Ward the Musical. \n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Webber's next project would be a musical adaptation of the 2003 film School of Rock.  On January 19, 2015, auditions opened for children aged nine to fifteen in cooperation with the School of Rock music education program, which predated the film by several years. \n\nAccusations of plagiarism\n\nLloyd Webber has been accused of plagiarism in his works. The Dutch composer Louis Andriessen commented that: \"There are two sorts of stealing (in music) \u2013 taking something and doing nothing with it, or going to work on what you've stolen. The first is plagiarism. Andrew Lloyd Webber has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\".\n \nHowever, Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, countered such accusations. He acknowledged a similarity between the Andante movement of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and the Jesus Christ Superstar song \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\n\n...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's. The song works in its own right as its many performers and audiences can witness. \n\nIn interviews promoting Amused to Death, Roger Waters, formerly of Pink Floyd, claimed that Lloyd Webber had copied a short chromatic riff from the 1971 song \"Echoes\" for sections of The Phantom of the Opera, released in 1986; nevertheless, he decided he did not want to file a lawsuit.  The songwriter Ray Repp also claimed that Lloyd Webber stole a different melody from his own song \"Till You\". Unlike Roger Waters, Ray Repp did decide to sue, but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour. \n\nPersonal life\n\nLloyd Webber has married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill on 24 July 1971 and they divorced on 14 November 1983. Together they had two children; a daughter and a son:\n*Hon. Imogen Lloyd Webber (born 31 March 1977)\n*Hon. Nicholas Lloyd Webber (born 2 July 1979)\n\nHe then married singer Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984 in Hampshire. He cast Brightman in the lead role in his musical The Phantom of the Opera, among other notable roles. They divorced on 3 January 1990.\n\nThirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991. They have three children, two sons and one daughter, all of whom were born in Westminster:\n*Hon. Alastair Adam Lloyd Webber (born 3 May 1992)\n*Hon. William Richard Lloyd Webber (born 24 August 1993)\n*Hon. Isabella Aurora Lloyd Webber (born 30 April 1996).\n\nThe Sunday Times Rich List 2006 ranked him the 87th-richest man in Britain with an estimated fortune of \u00a3700\u00a0million. His wealth increased to \u00a3750\u00a0million in 2007, but the publication ranked him 101st in 2008.  He lives at Sydmonton Court, Hampshire, and owns much of nearby Watership Down.\n\nLloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian art. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters \u2013 The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection. In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell Portrait of Angel Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation.  In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany.  An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights.  On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for \u00a334.7\u00a0million to an anonymous telephone bidder. \n\nLloyd Webber was made a Conservative life peer in 1997, however by the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times.  Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the UK's Conservative Party, allowing his song \"Take That Look Off Your Face\" to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated 1 million people before the 2005 general election.  In 2009, he publicly criticised the Labour government's introduction of a new 50% rate of income tax on Britain's top earners, claiming it would damage the country by encouraging talented people to leave.  In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. \nIn October 2015 Lloyd Webber was involved in a controversial House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan.  \n\nIn late 2009, Lloyd Webber had surgery for early-stage prostate cancer,  but had to be readmitted to hospital with post-operative infection in November. In January 2010, he declared he was cancer-free.  He had his prostate completely removed as a preventative measure. \n\nHonours and styles of address\n\nHonours\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was knighted by the Queen in 1992.

Jesus Christ Superstar (1973) was directed by Norman Jewison; Evita (1996) was directed by Alan Parker; and The Phantom of the Opera (2004) was directed by Joel Schumacher and co-produced by Lloyd Webber. Cats, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and By Jeeves have been adapted into made for television films that have been released on DVD and VHS and often air on BBC.\n\nA special performance of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of Love Never Dies. Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway. It received positive reviews and was No.1 on DVD charts in the UK and Ireland, and did well in America.\n\nIn February 2014, it was announced that Elton John's production company had acquired the rights to Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and is planning to adapt it as a new theatrical animated musical film. \n\nOther works\n\n*Variations (1978) \u2013 A set of musical variations on Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's Caprice in A\u00a0minor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist Gary Moore and pianist Rod Argent and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with Tell Me on a Sunday to form one show, Song and Dance. Lloyd Webber also used variation five as the basis for Unexpected Song in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to The South Bank Show.\n*Requiem (1985) \u2013 A classical choral work composed in honour of his father, William.\n*Watership Down (1999) - Lloyd Webber and Mike Batt, main soundtrack composer of the animated series adaptation of Richard Adams' novel of the same name, composed the song \"Fields of Sun\". The actual song was never used on the show, nor was it available on the CD soundtrack that was released at the time. He was however still credited for the unused song in the show's opening titles.",

Once there, they meet the frustrated songwriter David Seville, and despite a poor house wrecking first impression, they impress him with their singing talent. Seeing the opportunity for success, both human and chipmunks make a pact for them to sing his songs. While that ambition proves a frustrating struggle with the difficult trio, the dream does come true after all. However, that success presents its own trials as their unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke, plans to break up this family to exploit the boys. Can Dave and the Chipmunks discover what they really value amid the superficial glamor around them? Written by Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\nThe Last Man Home.......Is Not Alone.

They must find a new home and they end up at Dave's house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave's house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.\n(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of \"Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!\" and Alvin would say \"OooooK!!!\" Those two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I know your child will, because it is a fun movie.

                "text": "The Chipmunks - Biography | Billboard\nThe Chipmunks\nAlvin Simon Theodore Ross Bagdasarian David Seville\nPossibly the most popular TV and musical cartoon of all time, the Chipmunks enjoyed several periods of prosperity -- beginning with the '60s era of adolescent Baby Boomers, cresting in the '80s, when the Boomers' children were growing up, and riding the wave clear into the new millennium.\nThe man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry's \"The Trouble with Harry\" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), \"Armen's Theme\" and \"Gotta Get to Your House.\" In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit \"Witch Doctor\" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single \"The Chipmunk Song\" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. \"Alvin's Harmonica\" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of \"The Chipmunk Song\" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early '60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.\nAlthough Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the '60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn't enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the '90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998's A-Files: Alien Files.\nIn 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009's Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011's Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015's Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi\nRelated Artists\n",

Like the original big-screen Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007), this new one is a slapstick pacifier, the kind of movie that features gags like Simon getting three-point-shotted into a wastebasket by an angry jock. Yes, griping about intentionally stupid jokes in an intentionally silly sequel seems like a churlish and rather pointless thing to do. Yet when Alvin, Simon, and Theodore take the stage to perform a number like \u201cYou Really Got Me\u201d (sounding more like a pip-squeak Van Halen than the Kinks), or when they twirl around on top of a blender and toss off a smokin\u2019 a cappella version of \u201cYou Spin Me Round (Like a Record),\u201d it\u2019s funky, charming, and \u2014 yes \u2014 irresistible. In the age of Glee and American Idol, when even little kids groove on the pop of different eras, the songs in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel are natural-born showstoppers.\nThe trouble is, there are only three or four of them in the whole movie. My hopes were raised with the appearance of the Chipettes, a trio of Bambi-lashed female chipmunks who mail themselves to L.A. in a FedEx packet and sign a contract with Ian Hawk (David Cross), the evil agent-promoter from the first film. But they get to do exactly one song (it\u2019s a goodie, \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d). Mostly, we\u2019re stuck with a lame plastic plot that has Alvin and his boys going to high school, plus Zachary Levi (from NBC\u2019s Chuck, essentially taking over for Jason Lee, who makes only a token appearance) doing sub-Adam Sandler routines as the chipmunks\u2019 caretaker. Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. They\u2019ll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesn\u2019t make The Squeakquel good for them.

                "text": "Alvin Seville | Alvin and the Chipmunks Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nWork, failure, being alone, losing his cap, threats to his family and friends\nQuote\n\"OKAY!!\"\nAlvin Seville is one of The Chipmunks and the titular protagonist of the series and movies. He is the leader of the group as well as the self-proclaimed \"awesomest\" one. Alvin greatly relishes his role as band front man and his antics and ego regularly get him and his brothers (sometimes even Dave ) into trouble.\nContents\nBiography\n60s Series\nAlvin, the shortest of the Chipmunk brothers, is always scheming, whether it be because he wants to get out of chores ( Overworked Alvin ) or is just trying to find a place to relax ( Alvin's Cruise ). Alvin has much musical talent; he not only sings, but also plays the harmonica. He loves his harmonica and will play it any time he can, even if it ends up messing up the song (\" Alvin's Harmonica \"). Alvin has trouble grasping other languages or their cultures but enjoys traveling the world anyway (\" I Wish I Could Speak French \", \" Comin' Thru' the Rye \").\nHe can be lazy when it comes to working, but he is very imaginative ( Sir Alvin ). He doesn't take lightly to people insulting him and his brothers' music ( Squares ), and sometimes even resorts to violence when dealing with people he dislikes (Daisy Bell in \"Three Blind Mice\"). He will also manipulate people when his fame is at stake ( Disc Jockey ). At times the selfish side of Alvin can take over, but, in the end, he always returns to help his brothers and Dave ( Alvin's Alter-Ego ).\nAlvin's interest in girls isn't as strong as in later incarnations, but he definitely is a charmer (\" August Dear \").\n80s Series\nAlvin is the oldest, as revealed in the episode Grounded Chipmunk after making the statement, \"I've never been alone, except those five minutes before Simon was born.\"\nAlvin is charming, musical (able to play guitar, piano, and harmonica, among many others), and full of animal magnetism. He always seems to make up hare-brained schemes to accomplish whatever his goal at the time is; whether it be trying to help his brothers, keeping Dave from figuring something out, or getting out of a sticky situation. However, Simon seems to refer to his often illogical or crazy plans as challenging the ordinary.\nAlvin has always possessed an impulsive behavior which has, at times, irritated or angered others around him, most obviously Dave. At times Alvin's determination can be viewed as being thoughtless, greedy, or manipulative. As a result of his constant habit of reacting to opportunity, Alvin has gotten his brothers or himself in trouble quite a few times such as the balloon race in The Chipmunk Adventure and a large number of episodes.\nAlthough Alvin is very much self-centered, he does care about his brothers. In Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman, Alvin helped Theodore temporarily get a bully off his case, causing the principal to remark, \"I'll say this for Alvin: he sticks up for his little brother.\"\nAlvin is an emotional roller coaster: his enthusiasm endless and despair bottomless. Alvin is often shown to be quite self-absorbed and greedy, but is also seen to be selfless and giving such as when he gives away his harmonica, one of his most prized possessions, to a child with a terminal illness in A Chipmunk Christmas . In A Chipmunk Reunion , Alvin has a difficult time forgiving his mother for leaving them until the end.\nAlvin is commonly portrayed as the charming member of the trio. In the Dr. Simon and Mr. Heartthrob \u00a0episode, he dresses stylishly and attempts to attract a group of visiting girls before being usurped by Simon, who drank a special kind of elixir which granted him natural magnetism and charm.\nCGI Films\nAlvin retains some of the traits he possessed from the 80s such as his impulsiveness, desire for fun, and charm as seen in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel where he manages to capture the attention of a group of girls using his cute looks and as well as the French language (e.g. he called Becca Mademoiselle after kissing her finger). Nevertheless, he has difficulty at showing affection toward Dave such as in the first film, Alvin and the Chipmunks, where he struggles at telling Dave that he loves him as a father, but less so with his brothers such as the time Alvin tried to kiss Simon to cheer him up in the second film.\nCGI Series\nAlvin contains much of his traditional personality: charming, impulsive, and self-centered. He continues to flirt with women such as the principal ( Principal Interest ) or have crushes on famous individuals ( Mister Manners ). Though he acts in his self-interest, he recognizes when his schemes go too far and does what's necessary to make up to the one he hurt ( To Serve And Protect ). He's still protective of his brothers ( Bully For You ) and has familiar emotional attachment at times ( Warbie ). Alvin retains his sporty lifestyle of the 80s, frequently seen on his skateboard ( What A Gem ), though tends to go too far when others are concerned ( Mutiny ).\nAppearance\nAlvin's signature appearance has changed over the years. Before The Alvin Show, Alvin looked like a normal chipmunk somewhat similar to his CGI films appearance. Alvin wears just a red shirt with the letter 'A'. After The Alvin Show was created Alvin was given more human features. His red shirt with his signature yellow 'A' is lengthen to go down to his new black shoes. Alvin was also given a red baseball cap and is the shortest of his brothers.\nIn Chipmunk Punk , Alvin wears clothes similar to The Alvin Show with the red sweater and matching hat but now wears white and dark blue shoes, since the album was released Alvin has a box cut instead of his regular hair as to match the visual style of the cover.\nWhen the Alvin and the Chipmunks series was created, Alvin wore a red sweater with his signature yellow 'A' and a baseball cap. He also wore white and blue pattern shoes. In the early episodes, Alvin's eye color is black but as the series progressed, his eye color changed to blue. In some episodes, Alvin wears light red footie pajamas with an 'A' on it, while in others, he wears a red t-shirt with a yellow 'A' on it along with red pajama pants.\nIn the CGI/live-action films, Alvin only wears a red hoodie with a yellow 'A' on it. His appearance was modified to look more closely to a real life chipmunk and has brown eyes. In the 2007 Alvin and the Chipmunks, Alvin is only seen wearing his cap twice; the first time on a magazine cover and the second at the end of the movie.\nIn ALVINNN!!! and The Chipmunks , he wears a red and blue-hooded sweater with his signature yellow \"A\" on it, which also has a hole in the left sleeve (right in the promotional images), blue jeans, and red/orange/white converse shoes. Alvin regains his signature red baseball cap as a common accessory, but it now has green under the visor and orange on the top-visor. He also has light orange-brownish fur.\nRelationships\nDave\nThe relationship between Alvin and Dave is frustrating for the two of them at times. Frequently Alvin won't cooperate which makes Dave scream his signature catchphrase \"ALLLVIIINNNN!!!!\", to which Alvin replies with a loud \"OKAY!!\" Although they can both irritate each other, they really love and care for each other.\nSimon\nAlthough the two of them are brothers, Alvin and Simon argue a lot of times because of their differences. In The Alvin Show, Alvin and Simon didn't fight too much or have a developing relationship until in the 1980's series. Alvin and Simon have a large bonding relationship in Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman while trying to find a cure for Theodore. It is obvious Alvin cares for Simon because in Bully For You , he wanted to help save Simon from Derek , the school bully.\nTheodore\nAlvin's relationship with Theodore can sometimes be hard for Theodore. Sometimes Alvin enjoys playing pranks and teasing Theodore, which usually upsets Theodore, sometimes Alvin doesn't realize that he would hurt Theodore's feelings. Although Alvin enjoys pranking Theodore, he cares and stands up for him because in Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman , he saved Theodore from Nathan , the school bully.\nAlvin: Are you in, or...in? - ( Meet the Wolfman )\nAlvin: That's it! I can't take this anymore. I can't! I give up! I'm sick of struggling for survival, competing with gophers and earthworms and that loser sparrow who always takes my nuts! And I'm especially sick of this stupid! Stupid! TREE!! - ( Alvin and the Chipmunks )\nAlvin: Dave likes to wear, dirty underwear, with little hairs! - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: Our parents were hippies. They left early to join a commune. - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: We're not performing monkeys, Dave! Why do we have to sing for that guy anyway? - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: MAJOR ROCK STARS. - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: We're not watching TV! - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: Simon, Theodore, help! - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: You'll never take us alive!!! - (Alvin and the Chipmunks)\nAlvin: Oh, relax. Like Ryan says, who's going to beat singing chipmunks? - ( The Squeakquel )\nAlvin: I never thought I'd say this, but...pink is my new favorite color. - (The Squeakquel)\nAlvin: Got it. Straight to the top. Ironic. - (The Squeakquel)\nAlvin: Simon, this is ridiculous. Building a shelter was your idea! Yours!!! - (Chipwrecked)\nAlvin: Ah, I see your problem. It's obvious. This has been written by aliens. - ( Un-Send! )\nTrivia\nThe origin of his name comes from Alvin Bennett . [1]\nOver the years, he had crushes (or interests) on many human female characters. Some examples include Miss Fancy from the 60s episode Fancy , Sandy the Babysitter and his math teacher Miss Stone from the 80s series episode Romancing Miss Stone , Dena from Funny, We Shrunk the Adults , Becca in The Squeakquel , and The Principal from the ALVINNN!!! series.\nEven though Alvin is the oldest by five minutes (as stated in the 80s episode Grounded Chipmunk ), many fans believe that he is younger than Simon since Simon is taller and more mentally mature.\nAlvin's age is unknown in the CGI/live-action films.\nAlvin refers to himself as the \"middle child\" in the ALVINNN!!! series episode The Sub .\nIn the CGI/live-action films, Alvin has only worn his baseball cap in the 2007 movie (in a magazine and at the end).\nIn the CGI/live-action films, Alvin is also depicted as having the ability to speak basic French unlike in both the 1980's animated series and\u00a0 The Alvin Show in which\u00a0he is shown to be unable to speak French in \"Petit Papa Noel\" from A Very Merry Chipmunk , and he is shown to wish he could speak French in The Alvin Show\u00a0musical segment \" I Wish I Could Speak French .\"\nAccording to Romancing Miss Stone, Alvin says that his birthday is nearby and he is turning nine years old (along with his brothers). However, later on in the series, they are stated to be eight years old several times.\nAlvin's attire has changed many times throughout the franchise with him wearing the most clothes in the new CGI series and him wearing the least amount of clothes in the live action/CGI films.\nDuring the 2000-era, Alvin was, and is, known as the self-appointed \"leader\" of the group. And, presumably meaning The Alvin Show , he suffered from small \"munk\" complex and tried to make up for it with his grand schemes and animal magnetism.\nIn the CGI/live-action films, Alvin is shown to have great hands when catching: in The Squeakquel (when he joins the football team and makes a game-winning touchdown catch), Chipwrecked (he catches a pocket knife with one hand in mid-air), and The Road Chip (he catches a ring with one hand in mid-air, with a fully-extended body).\nAlso see\n",

For other specials with the same title, see A Christmas Story (disambiguation) .\nA Christmas Story is a 1983 American/Canadian comedy film based on the short stories and semi-fictional anecdotes of author and raconteur Jean Shepherd , including material from his books In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash and Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. Directed by Bob Clark, the film has since become a holiday classic and is known for being shown numerous times on television during the Christmas season.  In 2012, the Library of Congress recognized the film and was chosen for preservation into its National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\" [1]\nContents\nSynopsis\nSPOILER: Plot details or story follow.\nThe film is set in the fictional city of Hohman (based on real-life city of Hammond, Indiana). 9-year-old Ralph \"Ralphie\" Parker wants only one thing for Christmas: \"an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock, and this thing which tells time.\" Between run-ins with his younger brother Randy and having to handle school bully Scut Farkus, and his sidekick Grover Dill, Ralphie does not know how he will ever survive long enough to get the BB gun for Christmas.\nRalphie Parker, the film's protagonist.\nThe plot revolves around Ralphie's overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to his owning the precious Red Ryder BB gun: the fear that he will shoot his eye out (the classic BB gun mother's block, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\") In each of the film's three acts, Ralphie makes his case to another individual; each time he is met by the same retort. When Ralphie asks his mother for a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, she says, \"No, you'll shoot your eye out.\" Next, when Ralphie writes a theme about wanting the BB gun for Mrs. Shields, his teacher at Warren G. Harding Elementary School, Ralphie gets a C+, and Mrs. Shields writes \"P.S. You'll shoot your eye out\" on it. Finally, when Ralphie asks an obnoxious department store Santa Claus for a Red Ryder BB gun, he responds, \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!\", before pushing Ralphie down a long slide with his boot.\nOne day after he gets the C+ on his composition, Ralphie is struck in the face with a snowball thrown at him by the bully Scut Farkus who then begins to tease and taunt Ralphie. Ralphie finally reaches his breaking point and then charges at Farkus knocking him down, and after knocking down Grover Dill, who tries to intervene for his pal, proceeds to beat Scut's face bloody. During the fight, Ralphie begins to swear non-stop as he lands blow after blow to the squealing Farkus. Ralphie's mother shows up and pulls her son off the bully, and takes him home. This part of the film occurs shortly after a scene where Ralphie gets into trouble for swearing while helping his father fix a flat tire. Ralphie is worried about the swearing and is sure he will be in big trouble when his father gets home from work. Instead, Ralphie's mother tells his father about the fight casually at the dinner table. She then changes the subject of the conversation to an upcoming Chicago Bears game, distracting his father and getting Ralphie off the hook in the process.\nOn Christmas morning, Ralphie looks frantically for a box that would hold the BB gun to no avail. He and his brother have quite a few presents, but he is disappointed because he did not get the gun. His disappointment turns to joy as his father points out one last half-hidden present, ostensibly from Santa. As Ralphie unwraps the BB gun, Mr. Parker explains the purchase to his none-too-thrilled wife, stating that he had one himself when he was 8 years old.\nRalphie goes out to test his new gun, shooting at a paper target perched on top of a metal sign, and predictably gets a ricochet from the metal sign. This ricochet ends up hitting just below his eye, which causes him to flinch and lose his glasses. While searching for the glasses, Ralphie ends up stepping on them, breaking them. However, he concocts a story to his mother about an icicle falling on him and breaking his glasses, which she believes. Suddenly, a horde of the next door neighbor's dogs, which frequently bother Ralphie's father, manages to get into the house, trash the kitchen and eat the turkey that was prepared for that evening's meal. Making a last-minute decision, Ralphie's father takes everyone out to a Chinese restaurant where they have a hilarious time eating what the narrator calls \"Chinese Turkey\" (in reality, Peking Duck, cooked complete with the head).\nAt the end of the story, we see Ralphie lying in bed on Christmas night with his gun by his side. Randy is holding the toy zeppelin he received. The voiceover states that this was the best present he received or would ever receive.\nSubplots\nSeveral subplots are incorporated in the body of the film, based on other separate short stories by Shepherd. The most notable involves the Old Man winning a \"major award.\" He entered a trivia contest out of the newspaper, which asked for the name of The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse (thanks to his wife, who supplied the answer: Victor). A large crate arrived and inside was a lamp shaped like a woman's leg wearing fishnet stockings, much to Mrs. Parker's displeasure. Just two days later, Mrs. Parker broke the lamp, infuriating the Old Man. The leg was the logo of the contest's sponsor, the Nehi bottling company (the details of the contest were not necessarily made clear in the movie).\nOther vignettes include:\nRalphie's friends Flick and Schwartz disputing over whether a person's tongue will stick to a frozen flagpole. Schwartz ultimately issues Flick a \"triple dog dare\" (the most serious of those used by the kids), and Flick's tongue gets stuck to the pole, much to his terror. A suction tube within the flagpole was used to simulate the freezing of Flick's tongue to the pole.\nRalphie receiving his Secret Society decoder pin from the Little Orphan Annie radio show. After weeks of anxious waiting, and missing out on the daily \"secret message\" (which to a kid appeared very important) Ralphie finally is able to participate. *However, he learns a lesson in being ripped off, as the secret message turned out to be an Ovaltine radio commercial.\nRalphie and his friends dealing with the neighborhood bully, Scotty Farkus (Zack Ward).\nThe Old Man's legendary battles with the aging and malfunctioning furnace.\nRalphie letting slip the dreaded \"Queen Mother of Dirty Words\", the \"F-dash-dash-dash word\" (censored with the word \"Fudge\" after his father knocks a hubcap from his hands, spilling its contents, the lug nuts from a flat tire) and later, when asked where he'd heard the bad word, falsely blaming his friend, Schwartz, and not pointing out that his father utters the word daily. After Ralphie's mother telephones Schwartz's mother to inform her that her son had been responsible for passing along the bad word to Ralphie, we hear Schwartz getting what appears to be the thrashing of his life at the hands of his hysterical mother. Ralphie himself gets a bar of soap in the mouth for saying the word. To keep it censored, Billingsly says \"fudge\" on camera (the narration points out that he really didn't say \"fudge\").\nThe numerous smelly and bothersome bloodhounds of the next door neighbors, the Bumpuses, including the dogs destroying the Christmas turkey (prompting the family to go out and have Peking duck instead, resulting in a giggling fit by the mother and the boys).\nSeveral fantasy sequences depict Ralphie's daydreams of glory and vindication, including the vanquishing of a small army of villains dressed in stereotypical burglar costume of flat caps, black masks and striped shirts with his Red Ryder BB gun obtaining his parents' gratitude, an extremely good grade for his written theme about the BB gun, and parental remorse over a case of \"soap poisoning\" (related to his cursing).\nMrs. Parker's misadventures in overly bundling Randy up for the winter weather by wrapping him in sweaters and a jacket so tightly he is unable to put his arms down, then Randy getting inadvertently knocked down and unable to get up under his own power (his only defense when they are confronted by Scotty Farkus.)\nRandy's refusal to eat a meal on his own incites hilarity between him and his mother at the dinner table.\nSpoilers end here.\nDrew Hocevar\nOne of the Two Christmas Elves\nIn the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who also appeared in several other Clark films. He cast Melinda Dillon on the basis of her similar role in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Peter Billingsley was already a minor star from co-hosting the TV series Real People; Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie, but decided he was \"too obvious\" a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right one after all. Ian Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark's film Murder by Decree, and Jeff Gillen was an old friend of Clark's who had been in one of his earliest films.\nShepherd provides the movie's narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the dramedy The Wonder Years . The film's writers, Jean Shepherd and Bob Clark. have cameo appearances in the film; Shepherd plays the man who directed Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line, and Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man was talking to outside during the Leg Lamp scene.\nHistory and related works\nOrigin\nThree of the semi-autobiographical short stories on which the film is based were originally published in Playboy magazine between 1964 and 1966. Shepherd later read \"Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder nails the Cleveland Street Kid\" and told the otherwise unpublished story \"Flick's Tongue\" on his WOR Radio talk show, as can be heard in one of the DVD extras. Bob Clark states on the DVD commentary that he became interested in Shepherd's work when he heard \"Flick's Tongue\" on the radio in 1968. Additional source material for the film, according to Clark, came from unpublished anecdotes Shepherd told live audiences \"on the college circuit.\"\nCritical reception\nInitially overlooked as a sleeper film, A Christmas Story was released a week before Thanksgiving 1983 to moderate success, earning about $2 million in its first weekend. Critics were severely divided on the film, with the majority of reviews on the negative side. Leonard Maltin proclaimed it a \"Top screen comedy,\" while Roger Ebert proclaimed it \"Funny and satirical ... a sort of Norman Rockwell crossed with MAD magazine. Vincent Canby's mostly negative New York Times review echoed the more common response. Critics seemed focused on the fact that Bob Clark, director of the critically reviled Porky's was the man behind the camera, and could not grasp the concept of Clark coming up with an instant classic like A Christmas Story The film would go on to win two Genie Awards, for Bob Clark's screenplay and direction. Years later, Ebert would re-evaluate the film, this time more favorably, writing that \"some of the movie sequences stand as classic.\"\nBy Christmas 1983, the film was no longer playing at most venues, but remained in about a hundred theaters until January 1984. Gross earnings were just over $19.2 million. In the years since, due to television airings and home video release, A Christmas Story has become widely popular and is now a perennial Christmas special. Originally released by MGM, Warner Bros. (through Turner Entertainment Co.) now has ownership of the film due to Ted Turner's purchase of MGM's pre-1986 library and Time Warner's subsequent purchase of Turner Entertainment.\nTelevision\nA Christmas Story first aired on television on HBO during the mid-eighties and quickly attracted a growing following. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the film began airing quietly on then-SuperStation WTBS and WGN America (then known as Superstation WGN). From 1988 to 1992, the film had a short-lived tradition of airing on the American Thanksgiving night (or the night after Thanksgiving) to open the holiday television season. In 1988, then-fledgling FOX network aired the movie the night after Thanksgiving. In 1989 and 1990, TBS showed it on Thanksgiving night, and in 1991 and 1992, they aired it the night after.\nTurner, now a part of Time Warner 's umbrella of cable networks, has maintained ownership of the broadcast rights, and since the mid-1990s, airing the movie increasingly on TBS, TNT and TCM . By 1995, it was aired on those networks a combined six times over December 24-25-26, and in 1996, it was aired eight times over those three days.\nDue to the increasing popularity of the film, in 1997, TNT began airing a 24-hour marathon dubbed \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story,\" consisting of the film shown twelve consecutive times beginning at 7 or 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve and ending Christmas Day. This was in addition to various other airings earlier in the month of December. In 2004, after TNT switched to a predominantly drama format, sister network TBS, under its comedy-based \"Very Funny\" moniker, took over the broadcast rights for the marathon. Clark stated that in 2002, an estimated 38.4 million people tuned into the marathon at one point or another, nearly one sixth of the country. TBS reported 45.4 million viewers in 2005, and 45.5 million in 2006. In 2007, new all-time ratings records were set, with the highest single showing (8 p.m. Christmas Eve) drawing 4.4 million viewers. Viewership increased again in 2008, with 8 p.m. Christmas Eve drawing 4.5 million viewers, and 10 p.m. drawing 4.3 million.\nIn 2007, the original tradition was revived as TNT aired A Christmas Story twice the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend (November 25). In 2011, the 24-hour marathon is scheduled to continue on TBS, for the 15th overall year, starting at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on Christmas Eve.\nHome video releases\nSettings\nLocations\nThe movie is set in a fictional town in Indiana, strongly resembling Hammond, Indiana where writer Jean Shepherd grew up. Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School, and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood years). Other Indiana references in the dialogue include a mention of a person \"swallowing a yo-yo\" in nearby Griffith, Indiana, the Old Man being one of the fiercest \"furnace fighters in northern Indiana\" and that his obscenities were \"hanging in space over Lake Michigan,\" a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus \"stretching all the way to Terre Haute.\" The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the Bears (who he jokingly calls the \"Chicago Chipmunks\") and White Sox, consistent with living in northwest Indiana.\nThe school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The school was sold to developers in 2005 and has been remodeled into a women's shelter. The Christmas tree purchasing scene was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, as it was the only location that still used red PCC streetcars - in fact, TTC streetcars can be seen during the scene. Ralphie beating up the neighborhood bully was also filmed in Toronto, as was the soundstage filming of interior shots of the Parker home. The St. Catharines' Museum owns some props used in the film, including two pairs of Ralphie's glasses (one of which is the smashed pair), and two scripts.\nDirector Bob Clark reportedly sent location scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland, Ohio, as the principal site for filming. Higbee's department store in downtown Cleveland was the stage for three scenes in A Christmas Story. The first is the opening scene in which Ralphie first spies the Red Ryder BB Gun. The second is the parade scene, filmed just outside Higbee's, on Public Square, at 3 AM. The final scene is Ralphie and Randy\u2019s visit to see Santa which was filmed inside Higbee's. Higbee's kept the Santa slide that was made for the movie and used it for several years after the movie\u2019s release. Higbee's was known for decades as a cornerstone of Public Square, as well as for its elaborate child-centered Christmas themes and decorations (e.g. the Twigbee Shop), with Santa as the centerpiece, until the store, which became Dillard's in 1992, closed for good in 2002. Higbee's was exclusive to Northeast Ohio\u2014there were no Higbee's stores in Shepherd's hometown. As such, he was most likely referring to Goldblatts in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Ave.) The parade was filmed at night for one reason. The producers wanted to film during day, but at this time, the BP Tower was under construction and during the daytime you could see the 1960s Erieview Tower and Federal Building from the Public Square.\nThe exterior shots (and select interior shots, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood where Ralphie lived were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as A Christmas Story House . The \"...only I didn't say fudge\" scene was filmed at the foot of Cherry Street in Toronto.\nIn 2008, two fans from Canada released a fan film documentary that visits every location used in the movie. Their film, Road Trip for Ralphie, was shot over two years and includes footage of the film makers saving Miss Shields's black board from the dumpster on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating all the original costumes from the movie and tracking down the real-life location of the movie's Chop Suey Palace in Toronto.\nMany years after the film was shot one of the old schools used in St. Catharines was demolished. During demolition, one of the movie scripts was found in the bleachers. It had scribbling on it from the directors.\nVehicles\nCleveland car buffs donated the use of a number of vintage vehicles for the film, which helped to enhance the authenticity of the production despite a limited budget. During filming in downtown Cleveland, members of a local antique automobile club, following a preset route, repeatedly circled the square. At the end of filming each day, the cars were thoroughly washed to remove road salt, and parked underground beneath the Terminal Tower.\nThe Parker family car was a 1937 Oldsmobile Model F-37 four-door trunkback sedan. It is made clear early on the Old Man's bittersweet relationship with his car, as revealed in the lines: \"Some men are Baptist, others Catholic; my father was an Oldsmobile man;\" \"That hot damn Olds has froze up again;\" \"That [SOB] would freeze up in the middle of summer on the equator!\".\nTransit fans will notice several Toronto pcc streetcars in a couple scenes.\nRalphie's Red Ryder BB Gun\nThe Red Ryder BB gun was available beginning in 1938 and for many years afterward (and indeed, still is), but never in the exact configuration mentioned in the film. The Daisy \"Buck Jones\" model did have a compass and a sundial in the stock, but these features were not included in the Red Ryder model. The compass and sundial were placed on Ralphie's BB gun but on the opposite side of the stock due to Billingsly being left-handed.\nTributes and parodies\nIn a segment produced for A Very Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Holiday Special , Dexter dares Johnny Bravo to stick his tongue on the TV monitors behind them, because Johnny thinks his tongue will not stick to them. In another segment of the broadcast, Chicken complains that he did not get the BB gun that he wanted, to which everyone replies, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"\nAt the beginning of The Powerpuff Girls Christmas special, 'Twas the Fight Before Christmas , Buttercup worries that she will not get an official Red Raider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range-model air rifle. Princess Morbucks responds, \"Who would want a stupid old BB gun? Besides, you'll shoot your eye out.\"\nIn the Back at the Barnyard Christmas episode, It's an Udderful Life , Eugene \"Snotty Boy\" Beadie wants a Red Ryder Reindeer Tazer as his Christmas gift.\nRalphie and the kid with goggles make a cameo in Grace Goodwin 's flashback in Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice .\nDating the story\nDirector Bob Clark stated in the film's commentary CD that he and author Shepherd wished for the movie to be seen as \"amorphously late 30's, early 40's.\" The film is not specifically about a given year, it is about a particular time in American family life. The film appears to be set roughly around the tail end of the Great Depression but before the United States involvement in World War II. There are references throughout the film that viewers enjoy linking to particular years, and if one connects a reference to a particular year, the movie can be \"dated\" as being as early as 1935 or as late as 1947. Some of the other \"year clues\" include - but are by no means limited to - the following:\n1935: In the scene where Ralphie and his friends peer into the Higbee's toy store window, Lionel's model of the Union Pacific M-10000 can be seen running around a loop of track. That model was made from 1935-1941.\nPre-1937: The tin Zeppelin mentioned in the original story (\"it rolls and it beeps\"), and appearing unremarked under the Christmas tree. Zeppelin travel ended for all intents and purposes with the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937.\n1937: Reference in the newspaper quiz to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , released by Disney that year. Snow White can also be seen in the Higbee's window.\nThe Parker family car.\n1938: The color comics on Christmas Day - implying a Sunday. Christmas fell on a Sunday in 1938.\n1939: Characters from The Wizard of Oz , released that year, appear in the Christmas parade.\n1940: The license plates on the cars are silver (white) on a black field. Those were the colors of the Indiana license plates that year.\nEach year, Ovaltine brought out a different model for this decoder ring. The Radio Orphan Annie secret decoder model used in the movie is the 1940 model.\nThe Red Ryder Daisy BB gun with \"Golden Bands\" was offered only in the first year of its manufacture.  Christmas 1940 would be accurate for the Goden Band model.  Scenes in the movie clearly show the rifle had golden bands.  Additionally the 1940 Daisy pre-Christmas ads shown in the movie feature the gold banded rifle.  In short the Red Ryder Daisy with \"gold bands\" ties the movie to Christmas 1940.\n1943: The Bing Crosby/Andrews Sisters recordings of \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" are both very clearly heard on the living room radio (both recorded on September 27, 1943).\n1946: Ralphie's father complains in the movie that \"the Sox traded Bullfrog!\" which is a reference to Chicago White Sox pitcher Bill Dietrich, who was in fact released from the Sox, not traded, in 1946.\n1947: The police car in the schoolyard scene.\nMany other \"year specific\" references can be found in the film, as 1939-40 is slightly later than author Jean Shepherd's own childhood (he was 19 years old in 1940) but earlier than that of director Bob Clark (who was born in 1939). While Shepherd was age 10 in 1931, Clark was age 10 in 1949 - a separation of 18 years. If the consensus between Shepherd and Clark was to find a \"middle-ground\" for their youths, they may well have divided the difference in half (9), then added that amount of years to the earliest date (1931), thereby arriving at 1940.\nThese minor contradictory items only indicate what director Bob Clark said in his commentary, as previously stated above: The film is set in the \"amorphously later Thirties, early Forties.\" The movie is intended as a credible, warm and thoroughly inviting memory of an innocent American Christmas around the World War II era. The individual viewer can elect to \"date\" the film to any year they wish, but for whatever year they choose, many contradictions occur within the film, and this fits exactly with the writer and directors idea of \"around 1940\".\nSequel\nIn 1994, a sequel with the same characters, but none of the same cast, was released. Titled It Runs In The Family (or My Summer Story), it told some further adventures of Ralphie and his family. While available on DVD, both it and its connection to the holiday classic are nearly unknown.\nA more direct sequel, a direct-to-video film titled A Christmas Story 2 , was released by Warner Bros. on October 30, 2012.\nSoundtrack\nRalphie's Revenge & the \"F\" Word\nJoy To the World & Silent Night\nThe Bumpus Hounds Make Their Rounds\nGlorious, Beautiful Christmas (closing credits music)\nSilent Night - Mormon Tabernacle Choir\nA Christmas Story House\nHome Hunting\nThe house that was used as the Parker residence is located in Cleveland, Ohio\nFor the film adaptation of these stories, Bob Clark chose Cleveland, Ohio because of Higbee's Department Store. Scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee's vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take on the project on the condition he be allowed to edit the script for cursing (namely \"the Queen Mother of Dirty Words\"). Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up. In addition to the house exteriors, Cleveland was the location used for the scenes involving Higbee's department store, despite the fact that there were no Higbee's stores in Shepherd's hometown.\nRestoration and reconfiguration\nIn December 2004, Brian Jones, a San Diego entrepreneur and fan of the film since childhood, bought the house used by the producers as the Parker home on eBay for $150,000. Jones used revenue from his business, The Red Rider Leg Lamp Company, which manufactures replicas of the \"major award\" Ralphie's father won in the film, for the down payment. The previous owners had reconfigured installing modern windows, and covered the original wood siding with blue vinyl. Watching the movie frame by frame, Jones drew detailed plans of the interiors \u2014 which had been filmed on a Toronto sound stage \u2014 and spent US $ 240,000 to gut the structure, reconfigure it to a single-family dwelling, transform it into a near-replica of the movie set, and restore the exterior to its appearance in the film.\nA Christmas Story House Museum\nJones purchased the house across the street and converted it into A Christmas Story House Museum, which contains some of the props from the movie, including Randy's snow suit, the Higbee's window toys, and hundreds of behind the scenes photos. The house to the left of the museum features a gift shop with movie memorabilia, which opened to the public on November 25, 2006, with original cast members attending the grand opening, and the site drew 4,300 visitors during its first weekend.\nRelated promotions\nAccording to their official web site , the official Christmas Story Chinese Restaurant is \"The Pearl of the Orient.\"\nThe Renaissance Cleveland Hotel offers a package deal for two that includes overnight accommodations and tickets to the House. As a bonus, the film is aired in the room 24 hours a day. Patty LaFountaine-Johnson, a local actress who portrayed one of the Higbee Santa's elves, hand-sews and autographs red-and-green felt hats similar to her movie costume and sells them at the house's gift shop.\nBroadway musical\nIn 2012, a musical version of the holiday classic, co-executive produced by Peter Billingsley, ran during the holiday season at the Lunt-Fontaine Theatre. \u00a0The show was revived at The Theatre at Madison Square Garden for 2013.\n",

                "text": "Chip and Dale | Disney Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\n[Source]\nChip and Dale are a pair of cunning and mischievous chipmunks. Although the duo have similar looks and rarely appear separately, they each have distinct personalities and a few distinguishing physical features.\nChip can be identified by his small black \"chocolate chip\" nose and a single front tooth, whereas Dale has a larger nose which is red and two adjacent front teeth. Chip is also usually the more logical, positive, and cunning of the two, with Dale being the less intelligent.\nContents\nBackground\nPersonalities\nChip is the brains of the duo and thus is shown to be clever, fearless and somewhat bossy. Unlike his best friend, he's a quick thinker. When dealing with Donald, Chip shows to be much more of a threat than Dale, both mentally and physically. He is also no-nonsense and becomes easily frustrated with Dale's incompetence. In Rescue Rangers, Chip constantly thinks about being on duty to the point where he is thought to not know how to be fun; because of such, Dale's blundering causes him nothing but headaches.\nDale is sometimes lazy, dim-witted and clumsy, and can be a little more sensitive. In earlier appearances, he was completely foolish to the point where he can truly be called an idiot. In later years, that aspect of his personality was toned down to just being carefree, fun-loving, and goofy. In Rescue Rangers, Dale wears a Hawaiian shirt, possibly to show how relaxed his personality is; he gets along easier with Monterey Jack and Zipper than Chip.\nWhile the two are nearly inseparable and count each other as their closest friends, the one thing that can tear them apart is a romantic interest. They have been known to have feelings for the same girl most of the time and battle each other for the affections of the girl in question. In Rescue Rangers, both are in love with Gadget, but can't seem to be open about their feelings, nor does she notice at all.\nVoices\nThe classic voices of Chip and Dale were mostly provided by Helen Silbert, Dessie Flynn /Dessie Miller and James MacDonald . The earliest voices of the chipmunks were provided by female office staff, without credit.\nIn Private Pluto , the chipmunks' speech was created by speeding up sound clips of normal speech. In a number of the shorts that followed, many of these same sound clips were re-used again and again, though later shorts used new dialogue specifically recorded for them.\nAt one point in Winter Storage , Chip and Dale get into an argument while caught in a trap. When the scene switches to an outside view of the box (with Donald Duck sitting on the box), the dialogue being heard is actually a sped-up segment of the voice-over narration from the Goofy short A Knight for a Day .\nSince 1988 , Chip has been voiced by Tress MacNeille and Dale has been voiced by Corey Burton . However, in Mickey Mouse Works, House of Mouse, the first season of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and the Have a Laugh! versions of the classic shorts, Tress voiced both chipmunks.\nHistory\nChip and Dale in their first appearance, Private Pluto .\nChip and Dale first appeared in a 1943 Pluto cartoon titled Private Pluto . In this appearance, they look a lot more like realistic chipmunks and did not have names. The two then-nameless twin chipmunks were never intended to be used again after that short, but when Walt Disney needed new characters to challenge Donald Duck , a decision was made to revive the two chipmunks, leading them to acquire their now-familiar names and personalities.\nTheir names are a pun on the name \"Chippendale\" (a reference to furniture-maker Thomas Chippendale ). This was suggested by Bill \"Tex\" Henson, a screenwriter at the studio.\nAs mentioned, Chip and Dale began their careers in Private Pluto. In that cartoon, Pluto is a part of the army and runs into trouble when it appears that two nameless chipmunks are hanging around the site in a pillbox. In this appearance, the two were completely indistinguishable in terms of both appearance and personalities. Afterward, the two would later appear in several of Pluto's cartoons, as well as those including Mickey Mouse .\nThey did not get their names until the short Chip an' Dale . In that short, they meet their new nemesis Donald Duck, whom they would make countless appearances with, even beyond the animated short films. The chipmunks became far more famous for antagonizing Donald and are possibly best known for appearing in his shorts, having gained their trademark appearances and personas when dealing with the hot-tempered duck.\nChip and Dale became so popular that they were able to star in their own series of cartoons, joining Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy and Pluto . Only three shorts were created in that series. The first was Chicken in the Rough , where Dale becomes trapped in a chicken coop and needed to be rescued. The next and most famous one was Two Chips and a Miss , where they go out to a nightclub and battle for the attention of a female chipmunk named Clarice . The last was The Lone Chipmunks , where Chip 'n' Dale foil the outlaw Pete .\nQuite often in these shorts, their tails flicker and sometimes they are both seen running on all fours, much like actual chipmunks. An interesting note is that, in earlier shorts, they had the appearance of more realistic chipmunks (much like the woodland creatures in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ), only to gain their iconic, far more cartoony designs once their popularity and screen time grew.\nAppearances\nWalt Disney anthology series\nIn a 1959 episode of the anthology series entitled \" The Adventures of Chip 'n' Dale \", Walt Disney was unable to host the show personally. Instead, he left a message on his tape recorder informing viewers of his arrangements to have Chip and Dale host in his place. The chipmunks use the time to go through an old book which holds memories of their fondest exploits.\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\nChip and Dale and the other main characters as they appeared in Rescue Rangers.\nAfter the success of DuckTales , Chip and Dale starred in their own series, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers . They were friends of a famous retiring police dog, whose owner was framed by a crime boss for stealing a ruby. Through the adventure to retrieve the ruby and prove the cop's innocence, they met and recruited Gadget Hackwrench , Monterey Jack , and Zipper , forming the Rescue Rangers officially. They also get new enemies, most notably Fat Cat and Professor Norton Nimnul .\nChip serves as the unspoken leader of the group, while Dale tends to provide most of the comic relief, though Dale does end up becoming the hero at times. Both chipmunks possess a crush on Gadget, becoming rivals for her affections. A running gag in the show has Chip being constantly interrupted when he attempts to tell Gadget his feelings for her. The two have even been love interests themselves. In \" Adventures in Squirrelsitting \", a squirrel named Tammy falls in love with Chip, and in \" Good Times, Bat Times \", a bat named Foxglove falls in love with Dale. Both of them apparently don't return these affections.\nA live-action/CGI feature film based on the series is currently in development.\nChip and Dale in Mickey Mouse Works .\nChip and Dale are recurring characters in Mickey Mouse Works , where they are recast as enemies of Donald Duck once again.\nOne of the duo's most notable appearances in the series is in the short \" Mickey's Mixed Nuts \", where the chipmunks battle Mickey Mouse (someone that they didn't usually pester in past productions) for the last bag of nuts at a supermarket.\nMickey's Once Upon a Christmas\nChip and Dale appear in the segment Donald Duck: Stuck on Christmas. The two are briefly seen several times throughout the story. At the beginning, they are seen opening their presents. They appear again when they are hit with a snowball by Huey Duck, who then gets hit back by Chip. Their next appearance occurs near the end when an object is thrown into their home and it turns out to be a bag of nuts wrapped as presents from Huey, Dewey, and Louie . At the end, they are last seen throwing away their Christmas decorations and cleaning up.\nChip and Dale in House of Mouse\nChip and Dale have recurring roles in House of Mouse , primarily as guests at the club.\nBoth chipmunks are seen shaking hands with Donald Duck in the show's intro.\nThe episode \" Chip 'n' Dale \" is centered around the chipmunks as they spend their evening stealing bags of nuts from the guests while evading Donald. At the end of the episode, an advertisement is shown in which they seem to have their own storage organization where they store \"everything you don't need\".\nIn \" Ladies' Night \", Minnie hires them to perform an act as the \"Chip and Dale Dancers\".\nIn \" Ask Von Drake \", the chipmunks can be briefly seen during Ludwig Von Drake's headcount of all the Disney character guests .\nThe duo also appears in \" House of Turkey \", where Donald complains about how he can't understand what they're saying, only for Daisy to retaliate by saying that she can't understand him either.\nThey also appear briefly in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse . Right after Pluto's Christmas Tree is shown, Chip and Dale pop out of a small artificial tree and catch Pluto's attention. Pluto starts barking at them, but in a reprise of the closing gag from the preceding short, they slap a \"Do not open till Christmas\" sticker over his mouth.\nMickey Mouse Clubhouse\nChip and Dale are recurring characters in this computer animated series. They are some of Mickey's friends. Unusually, the two don't seem to have a rivalry with Donald and Pluto. Most of the chipmunks' roles in the series are minor with the exception of the episode \" Goofy's Coconutty Monkey \", where they are the culprits behind the mysterious disappearance of the jungle's coconuts. In the end, they returned their stash, thinking they were giant nuts. They play another significant role in the episode \" Goofy's Thinking Cap \" where Mickey, Donald, and Goofy need twelve nuts for Clarabelle's scavenger hunt, to which the chipmunks gladly oblige.\nChip and Dale with Mickey in Mickey Mouse.\nChip and Dale appear in the episode \" Space Walkies \".\nDuring a voyage in outer space, Mickey and Pluto step out of their spacecraft to allow Pluto a chance to relieve himself. After which, Mickey tries to rush Pluto back to the ship by using a miniature spacecraft resembling a frisbee disk. The disk, it turns out, is a craft owned by an annoyed Chip and Dale, who berate Mickey for toying with their craft before their appearance catches the attention of Pluto, and vice versa. Almost instantly, Pluto attacks the chipmunks, and a chase through space follows. On the rings of a planet, however, Chip and Dale are able to elude Mickey and Pluto, giggling at their success and their adversaries' misfortune.\nCameos\nIn Fun and Fancy Free , Chip and Dale briefly appear, laughing at Bongo the Bear 's failed attempt to climb a tree.\nIn Mickey's Christmas Carol , Chip and Dale make a cameo appearance dancing at Fezziwig 's Christmas party in Scrooge's past.\nDale makes a brief cameo appearance in the Quack Pack episode \" Hit the Road, Backwater Jack \" when a man is trying to empty things in his pockets.\nVideo Games\nChip and Dale are recurring characters in the Kingdom Hearts video game series .\nIn Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Chip and Dale are found in Disney Town , managing the Rumble Race tracks.

There doesn't seem to be any massively terrible pop songs I need to review right now. Well, I suppose I can finish off that Top 10 Worst Songs List of 19--[Suddenly his Skype alert goes off]\u00a0Lupa? Lupa?\n[Instead it's Film Brain]\nTodd: [dejected] Oh... Hi, Matthew.\nFB: So Todd, the fourth year anniversary's coming up. Do you wanna do another crossover?\nTodd: Oh absolutely, I really enjoyed watching Sunday School Musical. Okay, maybe not enjoyed...\nFB: Don't you wanna wait and see what movie I have planned?\nTodd: No it's cool, I trust your judgement. What is it?\nFB: Oh, nothing. Just [taking out the DVD of...] Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.\nTodd: [he takes out a shotgun and cocks it] Bring it on.\n[Now we get to the opening of Bad Movie Beatdown while we hear Todd playing a piano version of Ready To Roll. The opening contains additional clips of Todd this time.]\n[After the opening finishes, suddenly Todd busts into FB's hotel room, but without the shotgun]\nFB: Aah!\nTodd: Let's do this!\nFB: Didn't you have...a weapon?\nTodd: They would not let me take it on the plane. So, why did you pick that movie to review? Cause of its butchering of decent pop songs?\nFB: [smiling] No, I just like seeing my fellow contributors in pain.\nTodd: Yeah, I figured after the whole Rap Critic thing with Big Mama's House and all that. How can you stand all this crap?\nFB: [steepling his hands]\u00a0Because I'm insane.\nTodd: Yeah, no shit. Well, let's get this over with.\n[Image of Ross Bagdasarian]\nTodd (VO): In 1958, struggling songwriter Ross Bagdasarian found himself a winning gimmick after discovering he could make his voice sound funny by increasing the speed of the recording. [cover of \"Christmas with The Chipmunks\", slowly zooming out] He built three cartoon characters to fit the high pitch: Alvin, Simon and Theodore, The Chipmunks. They were a big hit in the '50s, [brief clip of '80s TV show] a big hit again during the '80s, [brief clip of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" (2007) movie trailer] and revived one more time by a live-action movie in 2007. [clips from the first movie play] And despite a terrible marketing campaign that prominently featured a scene where Alvin eats shit, I actually didn't think that movie was that bad. It actually had a few funny jokes, had a decent running plotline about making fun of the miserable behind the scenes machinery of teen pop stardom, and it was self aware about the silliness of making a live-action Chipmunks movie. Now keep in mind there's no way it could've actually been \"good\", per se, but when you got the movie versions of [posters of...] Garfield , Underdog or The Smurfs to compare it to, I maintain you could do worse.\nFB (VO): I agree, and I largely put this down to ex-Simpsons writer Jon Vitti being one of the writing team. I've watched it twice: once as a review candidate and once for this review before you harp on me, and it's harmless. It's not exactly great, but you could certainly do far worse. And honestly the kids loved it because it made a whopping $360 million dollars worldwide, so a sequel was inevitable.\nFB: Enter [holds up DVD case] the Squeakquel, which is exactly what you think the first one would be and then some. And as someone who's watched all three Alvin and the Chipmunk movies, I can tell you that this, by far, is the worst.\nTodd: You actually saw the third one? Is that even out on dvd yet?\nFB: [puts down DVD] I saw it in the theater in a professional capacity.\nTodd: Are you sure you're not obsessed--\nFB: You shut up! I'm not obsessed with Alvin and the Chipmunks!\nTodd: ...Why don't we go on to the review?\n[We start off at the Regency logo]\nTodd (VO): So the movie begins...\n[Suddenly a chipmunk laugh is heard, then a guitar chord]\nChipmunk: We're baaack!\nTodd: Well that's unnerving.\nFB: I think that sent a chill down every parents' spine.\nFB (VO): So the movie begins at a charity festival in Paris where the Chipmunks, full-fledged pop sensations are performing to a sell out crowd.\nChipmunks:\u00a0[singing The Kinks, \"You Really Got Me\"]\u00a0Girl, you really got me now/You got me so I don't know what I'm doing\nGirl, you really got me going/You got me so I can't sleep at night\nTodd: Well that was a brutal murder of a perfectly good song. God, what did Ray Davies ever do to you, Squeakquel?\nFB (VO): In fact they're so famous, they're even being broadcasted around the world.\nTodd (VO): Oh look, the eskimos are watching in their igloo. That's nice, movie. Never too young to introduce the kids to embarrasingly inaccurate stereotypes, I always say.\nFB (VO): Also back this time is Dave Seville, played once again by Jason Lee, wearing that pained look of someone who knows the phrase \"contractual obligation\" all too well. Alvin starts getting extremely into this gig, and because the chipmunks have throwing arms that would make Superman jealous, manages to get up into the scaffolding, pulling out some wiring by accident.\n[This makes a cardboard cutout of Alvin snap off and swing toward Dave]\nAlvin: Dave! Look out!\nTodd: Lot of punch in that cardboard cutout. Is Dave made of styrofoam or what?\n[Dave's now in traction in a hospital bedroom]\nFB (VO): That's right, Jason Lee so does not want to be in this movie that barely three minutes have passed before they start writing him out as he's stuck in a Parisian hospital bed. He tells the Chipmunks, voiced pointlessly by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney. not that you can tell, that they'll be in the care of Aunt Jackie.\nDave: I want you guys to go home and live a normal childhood. I even made arrangements for you to go to school.\nChipmunks: School?\nFB: I think that cardboard cutout seriously injured Dave's brain. I mean these are chipmunks, not children. They should be having normal chipmunk lives. I mean for goodness sake, what do they need to go to school for? Are you training them to be the next chipmunk lawyers, chipmunk scientists?\nFB (VO): And bye, Jason Lee. The Chipmunks are to be escorted out when Alvin predictably starts causing trouble.\n[Alvin jumps onto the bed remote which makes it go up and down, rocking Dave]\nDoctor: The more stress you put on Monsieur Seville, the longer it'll take him to recover!\nAlvin: You'll never take me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa--[suddenly the doctor shoots Alvin with a tranquilizer, making him go loopy] Daydream believer and a homecoming queen. [And Alvin drops onto the bed all conked out]\nSimon: Maybe we should give him another shot.\nTodd: Yeah, one more shot in that tiny body might actually kill him. Go right ahead.\nFB: I mean that's not one, but two scenes where he's caused grievous bodily harm. This movie's dark, man.\nFB (VO): So the Chipmunks fly back to America and this is where they meet Aunt Jackie. You know Dave, I don't think an elderly woman in a wheelchair is going to keep up with these tornadoes of destruction. Also with her is Toby, an aggravating gobshite played by that guy from Chuck.\u00a0[Zachary Levi]\nAunt Jackie: The luggage, get the luggage.\nToby: Yeah, let me get those.\n[Toby brushes against Aunt Jackie, making her go back]\nAunt Jackie: Toby!\nAlvin: Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!\nTheodore: Abandon wheelchair!\n[Aunt Jackie then starts going down the stairs and then gets hit by a cart]\nTodd: God, how many victims are the chipmunks gonna claim? One more and they're officially serial killers.\nFB: I mean nothing says \"good clean family entertainment\" like two people being hospitalized in the first ten minutes.\nFB (VO): So with Dave and Aunt Jackie taking permanent residence in hospitals for most of the remaining running time, it's up to Toby to take care of the Chipmunks. [sarcastic] Oh deep joy.\nToby: You guys have nothing to worry about seriously because I'm not gonna be anything like Dave. You know, Dave's gone.\nTheodore: Gone?\nToby: Not gone! Not \"gone\" gone. He's-he's-he's not dead, he's very much alive. He's completely coming back!\nTodd: When he wants another paycheck.\nFB: With each syllable this guy utters, the more I miss Jason Lee's unenthusiasm.\n[Alvin comes out of a cupboard with a bag of cheese balls]\nAlvin: Holla! The cheese balls are in the hizouse!\u00a0[singing Bee Gees, \"Stayin' Alive\"] Well you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a cheese balls man, no time to talk! Staying aliiiiiiii--[he holds that note for a long time]\nFB: [shutting his ears] Oh god!\nTodd: [facepalming]\u00a0Um, this really doesn't need a musical number.\n[Alvin jumps up to kick a pan down off the rack to pop the bag open]\nAlvin: --iiiiiiiive! Bingo!\nTodd: Wouldn't that just crush the cheese balls? Two people in the hospital and the cheese balls are okay?\nFB: Todd, Todd, Todd. If you've learned anything from the first ten minutes of the movie, it's that physics operates differently in the presence of talking chipmunks.\nFB (VO): And from one irritating shoehorned pop song to another.\n[The Chipmunks are riding in a bowl in a blender at high speed]\nChipmunks:\u00a0[singing Dead or Alive, \" You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) \"] You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round round.\n[The group soon gets flung across the room]\nFB: Well at least it's better than the Flo Rida cover.\nTodd: Hey, fun fact. Did you know that you could fit all three chipmunks in a blender? I certainly did.\n[The phone rings and Alvin and Simon answer it]\nChipmunks: Hello?\nAlvin:\u00a0[he hangs up on Dave]\u00a0Yup, nobody does that better than him.\nTodd: No, actually, he's quite terrible at it. Too panicky. Watch and learn.\n[We get a clip of the 50's cartoon]\nDave: Okay, Alvin? Alvin? [Alvin's trying to open presents] ALVIN!! [that makes Alvin jump to the mike]\nTodd: Note the threat of implied violence. That's how it's done.\nTodd (VO): Okay, so they go to school. High school, to be precise. Hang on, even in-universe, they're obviously way younger than high schoolers, so what the hell's going on?\nFB (VO): And I'm certainly not going to question Dave's judgement in sending three tiny chipmunks into a bustling school where they run the daily risk of being crushed, run over and stampeded on a daily basis for a completely pointless education.\n[Rolling down the halls on a skateboard is a kid in an Eagle mascot costume]\nMascot: Go Eagles!\nTheodore: Eagle!\u00a0[he turns tail and tries to run, but the mascot jumps over him, and then falls down a flight of stairs while the Chipmunks look on]\nFB: And that's another hospital well accounted for.\nTodd: I'm noticing a theme. Maybe we should just keep Alvin locked in a cage. That way no one gets killed.\nFB (VO): The Chipmunks are taken to their class where the girls instantly fawn over them. Oh yeah, I forgot. They're world famous singing chipmunks, so any normality is out of the window anyway. Some jocks are none too pleased about their lady stealing powers.\nRyan Edwards: Somebody's gonna have to knock those guys down to size.\n[Todd just sighs at that statement]\nFB: Okay, if you're sexually threatened by something you can carry in your back pocket, you've got some serious self confidence issues.\nFB (VO): The jock bullies show what big meanies they are by chasing the Chipmunks across the school, even giving Simon a dreaded swirlie.\nRyan: It's swirlie time!\nSimon: Oh come on guys this is so 1980's! Aaah! Please, please!\u00a0[and he gets swirlied]\nTodd: Just because you point out that it's an outdated clich\u00e9 doesn't excuse it.\nFB: Well I guess they figured the audience was so young enough that they wouldn't notice. Besides, is this really necessary? I think that toilet is enough to drown that chipmunk.\nRyan: It's the fatty ratty. [the kids are poking at Thedore who's on a locker]\nTheodore: Cut it out!\nTodd: What the hell could have happened there?\nFB: All I know is I'm firmly guarding my testicles.\nTodd (VO): Uh-oh, now they're in trouble. But the principal is willing to cut them a deal. You see their music program is gonna be shut down unless the school wins a music competition. God that sounds familiar...\nFB: I'm pretty sure there's a black Christian choir who could help you out with that.\nFB (VO): It turns out the principal is also a bit of a fan.\nDr. Rubin: I just cannot believe that you're actually sitting in my office! I have all of your CDs. I even went to see you last year in Denver!\nTodd (VO): Is she flirting with them? They're her students. And rodents. This is wrong on so many levels.\nFB: But you see, we're having a two-for-one sale on pedophilia and bestiality. Buy now and we throw in necrophilia absolutely free!\nTodd (VO): Meanwhile at JETT Records, the evil record producer from the first movie, Ian Hawke, played by David Cross, swears vengeance on the Chipmunks that ruined his career. He's apparently homeless and spends his time eating garbage from the company dumpster and fighting a rat for muffins.\nTodd: I feel like this is a metaphor of some kind for David Cross' participation in this franchise.\nFB: It's like the writers thought to themselves, \"How can we demean David Cross more than we already have?\"\nFB (VO): Somehow sneaking aboard a FedEx truck, enter the Chipettes; Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, pointlessly voiced by Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Amy Poehler, who are hit so hard by the pitch shifting you can't even tell them apart. They've come to see Ian because they think he can make them stars like Alvin and the Chipmunks. I know it's a minor point, but where on earth did Jeanette get those glasses? In the first film, Simon's glasses were actually explained, whereas here they come right out of the packet.\nTodd: Are you sure you're not taking this too seriously?\nFB: It's a point about laziness, okay?\nTodd: ...Okay.\nTodd (VO): Ian takes them to his \"office\" on the roof where the Chipettes show off their skills.\nChipettes: [singing Corinne Bailey Rae, \"Put Your Records On\"]\u00a0Girl, put your records on/Tell me your favorite song/You go ahead, let your hair down\nTodd: They're naked. This is bothering me.\nFB: Thank you! I'm glad I'm not the only one. I mean I know they're chipmunks, but they're so anthropomorphic that seeing them without clothes kind of freaks me out.\nTodd: Yeah, the furries might like this. I don't.\nTodd (VO): To make the chipmunks not think he's a homeless loser, he breaks into a model apartment with a grand piano?\nTodd: You do realize the realtor has to show up at some point, right?\nFB (VO): The following day we see...the Chipmunks playing dodgeball? Whose bright idea was that?\nAlvin: Remember your five D's: dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!\nFB: So Justin Long is Alvin, making a reference to Dodgeball, which Justin Long was in, and...oh shit. (This meta realization has made the gamma go up!)\nTodd: Oh look what you did, you made the universe divide by zero again.\nFB: Sorry?\nRyan: You're next, furball!\nAlvin: You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? I'm the only one here, so you must be talkin' to me.\n[Todd's facepalming]\nFB: Ah yes, a reference to that popular well-known children's movie, Taxi Driver.\nTodd: Hey, how do you think it would smell if you pressed Alvin in a George Foreman grill? I'm guessing delicious. [FB's nodding with a grin] Sorry, go on.\nFB (VO): It turns out that Alvin's got a good catching and throwing arm, and that the jocks actually want him for their football team.\nFB: Their football team? He's 8\" tall!\nTodd: Let it go, man. It's Chipmunk Town.\nFB (VO): And thus, Alvin becomes the most popular kid in school. Even has the pussy on demand if he wanted it. Of course if you already forgot...\nTodd (VO): I did.\nFB (VO): Quiet, you. The Chipmunks are joining the music competition which Ian sees in the newspaper.\nTodd (VO): So this is Ian's evil plan: he's going to use the Chipettes to steal the Chipmunks' fame by entering the Chipettes into the same school where Alvin and company promptly fall for their female counterparts.\nTodd: So, the school has two sets of singing chipmunks wandering around.\nFB: Surely the principal wouldn't allow this considering they might be a threat to the music contest?\nTodd (VO): And sure enough, Ian and his chest hair shows up to position the Chipettes as rivals to the Chipmunks in the contest.\nBrittany: [singing \" Hot N Cold \" by Katy Perry] You change your mind like a girl changes clothes.\nChipettes:\u00a0[singing] And you know that you're no good for me, yeeaahh! Cause you're hot and you're cold/You're yes then you're no/You're in and you're out/You're up and you're down.\nBrittany: Yeah yeah yeaaaahhh!\n[Meanwhile Ian's flailing around with lights strapped to his suit while a thought bubble saying \"KILL ME\" is put over him]\nTodd: You notice they skipped the line about PMSing like a bitch. Hey here's a riddle everybody; What's Kidz Bop, but worse?\nFB (VO): Ian convinces the principal to a public vote. Both groups will perform on Friday and whoever gets the most applause represents the school in the contest. That's if the Chipmunks can get their act together because Alvin and Simon are beginning to fall out over Alvin's popularity. This makes Theodore nervous, and he goes to sleep with Toby.\nTheodore: Can I sleep with you?\nToby: [sleepily] Sure, okay.\n[Theodore gets under the covers, but not before Toby blasts a fart]\nTheodore: Dutch oven! Not the Dutch oven! Oh, anything but the Dutch oven! Must find fresh air before it's too late! Aah! It's too late! It burns! Ohh, mama!\u00a0[he gets out of the covers and passes out]\nTodd: [facepalming again] Oh good, the obligatory fart joke.\nFB:\u00a0[imitating a kid]\u00a0Daddy, what's a Dutch oven?\nTodd: Cause Dave never farted in bed. Colon like daisies, that man.\nFB (VO): Speaking of Dave, the writers remembered that Jason Lee was in their movie as Toby answers Dave's call from Paris and lets slip that he's the one taking care of the kids. Dave immediately tries to get out of the hospital as soon as possible. Presumably around the point he discovered that My Name Is Earl was cancelled.\n[Dave tries to use the bed remote to lift his leg up, but pushes it too much that it lifts him off the bed]\nDave: Nurse! Get me out of here! Help!\nTodd: Okay, that one wasn't Alvin's fault, he's just an idiot.\nFB (VO): There's also a completely stupid filler scene here where the jock bullies tell Simon that he's a litter monitor, and then laugh at him as he takes his nonexistant position seriously. I thought Simon was supposed to be the smart one. Surely he'd see right through this blatant prank?\nTodd (VO): Well Simon gets thrown in the garbage and Alvin goes to help him, but they're pissed off at each other, especially when Alvin admits he may not be singing against the Chipettes because he has a football game at the same time.\n[Todd's facepalming again]\nFB: Oh, so it's becoming High School Musical.\nTodd: Okay, let me sum up the situation so far.\nTodd (VO): Alvin is in conflict with the other Chipmunks, who are in conflict with the school bullies, and they're all in conflict with the guy from Chuck, as well as with the Chipettes and with David Cross, who is taking advantage of the Chipettes as well as, for the record, setting the Chipettes in conflict with each other.\nTodd: Got all that? [FB shakes his head] Neither do I. What the hell is the plot of this movie?\nTodd (VO): So Alvin debuts on the football field in a stupendously stupid sequence.\nAlvin: I'm taking you down, Jennifer!\nLinebacker: You're the one going down, rat face.\nAlvin: I'm gonna crack you like an acorn, and eat you for dinner. With some fava beans and a nice Chianti. [And then proceeds to flick his tongue like Hannibal Lecter]\nFB: A Silence of the Lambs reference? Yeah, that's a film the kids should be aware of.\nTodd: Hey, maybe they'll reenact the mangina sequence next.\u00a0[Todd gives FB a creepy smile, which makes him scooch away from him]\nFB (VO): They throw the ball with Alvin on it, which I'm pretty sure is cheating, but there you go. [the ball lands down on top of Alvin] Ooh, he's dead! [Of course, Alvin's alive and well]\u00a0No, of course not, but he ends up scoring the winning touchdown, if you call it that, and is his usual irritating self.\nAlvin: That's what I'm talkin' about! Don't hate the player, hate the game! And I love how awesome I am! Uh-huh!\nFB (VO): Urge to kill rising!\nTodd (VO): Did you know that thousands of small rodents are killed every year by farming combines? Just a little piece of trivia, don't know why that popped in my head.\nFB (VO): At the same time during the sing-off, Alvin still hasn't arrived, and the Chipettes are up first.\nBrittany:\u00a0[singing Beyonce, \" Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) \"] All the single ladies. (All the single ladies) All the single ladies. (You put your hands up) Up in the club, just broke up, doing my own little thing. Decided to dip, now you wanna trip, cause another brother noticed me.\nChipettes: [singing] If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it. If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it.\nTodd: Oh good. Because Single Ladies wasn't enough of an annoying tuneless mess anyway, why not do it with chipmunk voices?\nFB: By the way, chipmunks in sexy dresses telling me that if I like it I should put a ring on it? Do not want!\nFB (VO): And because Toby is completely useless, he still hasn't found Alvin, and the Chipmunks have to forfeit, meaning the Chipettes win by default.\nTodd: [sarcastic] Oh no, this is horrible. Now they won't be able...to...\nFB: To see who would sing in a contest to save the school's music department.\nTodd: A what?\nFB: To save the school's music department.\nTodd: Oh, right.\nFB: Yes, don't worry about it.\nFB (VO): Alvin arrives late to realize he's a bit of a prick. Worse still during the night, Theodore, feeling upset over the lack of family unity, has run away to the zoo.\nTodd (VO): Whoa Matthew, you might wanna explain this for the people who haven't seen the movie.\nFB (VO): Good point. In one of the numerous sub-plots competing against each other in this mess, Theodore's inexplicably become a fan of the show Meerkat Manor, hence he has ran of to join the meerkats.\nFB: Well hopefully he won't get a cameo from this guy.\n[Quick clip from a Compare The Market commercial]\nAleksandr: Simples!\nTodd: What the hell was that?\nFB: It's a UK thing. Trust me, they found that hilarious.\nTodd: ...I'll take your word for it.\nTodd (VO): At the zoo, Theodore enters what he thinks is the meerkat exhibit, but has now been changed into the birds of prey exhibit instead, even though those wild animals would easily be able to fly out of the enclosure.\nTodd: And why would a talking animal want to live with a number of non-talking animals? And for that matter, can Theodore not read? And if he can't, why did he think meerkats were gonna be there in the first place?\nFB: It's so he can get rid of his fear of eagles, Todd. You know, the other asinine Theodore thing we've been skipping over cause there's so much crap in this movie.\nTodd: Oh yeah, right, we totally skipped that. Wow, there is a lot of shit in this.\nFB: There sure is.\nTodd (VO): Alvin, Simon and Toby come to the rescue--Okay, not so much in Toby's case, he's a moron--and Alvin talks to a distinctly uninterested eagle.\nAlvin: I get why you want Theodore. I do. But, I'm sorry. I can't let that happen. He's my brother. Not that you'd know that, because I've been such a big jerk lately.\nTodd: You know, I don't think there's much use talking to a non-talking animal.\nFB: I bet that eagle's thinking to himself, \"Mmm, tasty chipmunk! Om nom nom nom!\"\nTheodore: I gotcha, Alvin! [Theodore slips between the eagle's legs, stomps on it's foot to no effect, then runs with Alvin. Alvin slips through the screen, only for Theodore to get stuck.]\nTheodore: Help!\n[Alvin and Simon pull him out, then run away to the gate just as Toby finally got in]\nToby: Guys, that was huge!\nTodd: No, it really wasn't.\nTodd (VO): Also the Chipettes have captured the record company's attention and got a gig opening for Britney Spears. But oh no, they'll miss the competition, and Ian threatens them if they, or more specifically Brittany, don't sing.\nTodd: Are we really supposed to care about the fate of the music program?\nFB: And maybe I'm misreading this, but does Ian have a thing for Brittany? Please tell me he's not after some chipmunk tail.\nTodd (VO): Okay, competition's happening, got a few sub-Kidz Bop performances and for some reason, the Chipmunks are there even though they're not performing. Brittany calls Alvin, Ian's locked them in a cage.\nFB: And thus concludes the Chipettes doing a mini-remake of the first film.\nTodd: Oh no, if the kids don't arrive on time, they'll never be able to save the...what is it, the gym? The orphanage?\nFB: Close enough.\nFB (VO): So Alvin comes to the rescue on a toy motorbike, and with Simon's help, they break out of the cage and escape while Ian isn't looking. They hop onto the motorbike whilst Ian watches in horror and gives chase.\nAlvin: Don't worry! I'm gonna get a little help from my friend, Digger! Whoo!\n[Coming out of the sewer is a gopher named Digger]\nDigger: Roger that, Alvin! Whoa! Feels like I'm back at the racetrack!\nTodd: Who the heck was that?\nFB: That's...[he consults his notes on this] Digger, the NASCAR gopher.\nTodd: Who? No. Why?\nFB: Maybe it's to set up his own movie?\nTodd: Did he get one?\nFB: No.\n[Todd double facepalms while FB tosses his notes in the air]\nTodd (VO): Ian chases them with a toy helicopter, for some reason, and then Alvin and the Chipettes hop onto said helicopter, for some reason, they throw their helmets at Ian, forcing him to throw the plane's remote into the air which the Chipettes catch. And then the toy motorbike runs right into Ian's nuts.\nFB: It wouldn't be a lowest common denominator kids movie without some testicle smashing.\nTodd: I just want to point out that David Cross' memoirs are titled \"I Drink For A Reason.\" This is the reason.\nFB (VO): The two remaining Chipmunks are waiting for Alvin to return, so to stall, *fake gasp* wait, is Toby taking the stage?\nTodd (VO): Okay, here's another thing we forgot to mention. The school music teacher was the guy from Chuck's crush in high school. So now he's taken the stage, confessed his love/horribly embarrassed her. Sorry we skipped over that, but trust me if you blinked, you wouldn't have missed it anyway.\nToby: [singing badly] Ever since I met you, I want to be your guy. / But as you probably noticed, I'm...pathologically shy. / Standing on this stage right now I think I'd rather die, / so I'm just gonna start by saying...hi.\nFB: Your problem isn't that you're \"pathologically shy.\" It's that you're a stupid, filthy, jobless moron. Get off the stage!\nFB (VO): Luckily Alvin and the Chipettes fly in through a conveniently open window and join up with Simon and Theodore. Together they perform this completely unrehearsed, yet completely choreographed performance of [singing it] \"We Are Family.\" And look who's decided to show up five minutes from the end, it's Dave!\nTodd (VO): And the school wins the competition, saving the music department.\nTodd: And those music departments for all those other schools in the competition? Shut down.\nTodd (VO): As for the Britney Spears opener, uh, well...\n[Sticking out of the curtain is a sock puppet]\nIan:\u00a0[doing bad imitations]\u00a0\"Hey everyone. I'm Jeanette.\" \"And I'm Eleanor.\" [he comes out on stage in make-up and a dress] And I'm Brittany! And we're the Chipettes!\nTodd: Poor David Cross.\nFB: I bet he drinks Jack Daniels by the crate.\nTodd: We should do that after we're done.\nFB: You're damn right we should.\nTodd (VO): So Dave's returned and everything's back to normal. Dave even adopts the Chipettes alongside the Chipmunks.\nFB: So they're both adopted sisters and love interests?\nBoth: Eeewwww!\n[Dave turns the light off, but Alvin turns it back on]\nAlvin: Not tired!\nDave: Alvin, come on, it's time for bed.\u00a0[he turns the light off again and Alvin turns it on again]\nAlvin: Still not tired! [Another round of off and on]\u00a0More awake!\nDave: Alvin, that's it, don't make me come over there!\nAlvin: Okay!\n[Alvin turns the light off, only for Dave to trip on a skateboard, falling down once again. Alvin turns the light on once more.]\nTodd: Well that's Dave back in the hospital again.\nFB: Alvin's a shit.\nTodd (VO): And if you stick around during the credits you see the comeuppance for the jock bullies and David Cross being humiliated further still by being thrown into a dumpster. Again. You know, stuff they couldn't resolve in the main narrative.\nTodd: And why should they? They don't care. They made a shitload of money.\nFB: Almost half a billion dollars worldwide.\nTodd: ...I hate people.\n[Clips of the movie play as they give the closing summary]\nFB (VO): They just didn't care. The whole thing feels rushed because there are so many plot elements to throw into the mix here that it never falls into a cohesive storyline. It is a film filled with almost unparralelled annoyance. You want Alvin to die because he's so arrogant, you want to inflict pain on Zachary Levi for being so insufferable, and you want to slap some dignity into David Cross. The only wise person here is Jason Lee, who knew to sit out most of this dungheap for a borderline cameo appearance. His straight man presence is sorely missed.\nTodd (VO): This was a pointless embarrassment. The first movie was sort of admirable in how it at least poked fun at the stupidity of its own premise, but the Squeakquel--god that word sounds stupider everytime you say it--the Squeakquel has no interest in doing so whatsoever. It's just as stupid, but now it's given up trying to be clever about it, and the plotting is unruly half-assed. They introduce a conflict in one scene, completely ignore it for hour long stretches, then resolve it. This sucked. Screw you, Matt. Screw you.\nFB: I love you, too. I'm Matthew Buck, beating down bad movies everywhere.\nTodd: And I'm Todd in the Shadows saying, come on Matt, you only did this review because you love Alvin and the--\nFB: I AM NOT OBSESSED WITH ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS!!\n[He tackles Todd to the floor, then we go to credits]\n",

                "title": "Lauren Bacall",
                "text": "Lauren Bacall (, born Betty Joan Perske; September 16, 1924 \u2013 August 12, 2014) was an American actress known for her distinctive voice and sultry looks. She was named the 20th greatest female star of Classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute, and received an Academy Honorary Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2009, \"in recognition of her central place in the Golden Age of motion pictures.\"\n\nBacall began her career as a model, before making her debut as a leading lady with Humphrey Bogart in the film To Have and Have Not in 1944. She continued in the film noir genre with appearances with  Bogart in The Big Sleep (1946), Dark Passage (1947), and Key Largo (1948), and starred in the romantic comedies How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) with Marilyn Monroe and Designing Woman (1957) with Gregory Peck. She co-starred with John Wayne in his final film, The Shootist (1976). Bacall also worked on Broadway in musicals, earning Tony Awards for Applause (1970) and Woman of the Year (1981).  Her performance in The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996) earned her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nA month before her 90th birthday, Bacall died in New York City after a stroke.\n\nEarly life\n\nBacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in The Bronx, New York,  the only child of Natalie, n\u00e9e Weinstein-Bacal (1901\u20131977), a secretary who later legally changed her surname to Bacall, and William Perske, who worked in sales.  Both her parents were Jewish. According to Bacall, her mother immigrated from the Kingdom of Romania through Ellis Island, and her father was born in New Jersey, to parents who were born in an area of Poland which was referred to as Vistula Land, in the Russian Empire. \n\nSoon after her birth, Bacall's family moved to Brooklyn's Ocean Parkway.  She was educated with the financial support of her wealthy uncles at a private boarding school founded by philanthropist Eugene Heitler Lehman, named The Highland Manor Boarding School for Girls,  in Tarrytown, New York, and at Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. \n\nThrough her father, she was a relative of Shimon Peres (born Szymon Perski), the ninth President of Israel.   Peres has stated, \"In 1952 or 1953 I came to New York... Lauren Bacall called me, said that she wanted to meet, and we did. We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family... but I'm not exactly sure what our relation is... It was she who later said that she was my cousin, I didn't say that\". Her parents divorced when she was five; she later took the Romanian form of her mother's last name, Bacall.  She no longer saw her father and formed a very close bond with her mother, who remarried to Lee Goldberg and came to live in California after Bacall became a movie star.  \n\nEarly career and modeling\n\nIn 1941 Bacall took lessons at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where she was classmates with Kirk Douglas,  while working as a theatre usher at the St. James Theatre and fashion model.\n\nShe made her acting debut on Broadway in 1942, at age 17, as a walk-on in Johnny 2 X 4. By then, she lived with her mother on Bank Street, Greenwich Village, and in 1942 she was crowned Miss Greenwich Village. \n\nAs a teenage fashion model she appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar (the cover has since been described as 'iconic'),  as well as in magazines such as Vogue.  She was noted for her \"cat-like grace, tawny blonde hair and blue-green eyes\". \n\nThough Diana Vreeland is often credited with discovering Bacall for Harper's Bazaar, it was in fact Nicolas de Gunzburg who introduced the 18-year-old to Vreeland. He had first met Bacall at Tony's, a club in the East 50s . De Gunzburg suggested that Bacall stop by his Bazaar office the next day. He then turned over his find to Vreeland, who arranged for Louise Dahl-Wolfe to shoot Bacall in Kodachrome for the March 1943 cover. \n\nThe Harper's Bazaar cover caught the attention of Hollywood producer and director Howard Hawks' wife Slim, who urged Hawks to have Bacall take a screen test for To Have and Have Not. Hawks asked his secretary to find out more about her, but the secretary misunderstood and sent Bacall a ticket to come to Hollywood for the audition. \n\nHollywood\n\nAfter meeting Bacall in Hollywood, Hawks immediately signed her to a seven-year contract with a weekly salary of US$100, and personally began to manage her career. He changed her first name to Lauren, and she chose \"Bacall\" (a variant of her mother's maiden name) as her screen surname. Slim Hawks also took Bacall under her wing, dressing Bacall stylishly and guiding her in matters of elegance, manners and taste. At Hawks' suggestion, Bacall was also trained to make her voice lower and deeper instead of her normal high-pitched, nasal voice. Hawks had her, under the tutelage of a voice coach, lower the pitch of her voice. As part of her training, she was required to shout verses of Shakespeare for hours every day.  Her 5 feet, 8\u00bd inches, height, unusual among young female actors in filmmaking in the 1940s and 1950s also helped her stand out. Her voice was characterized as a \"smoky, sexual growl\" by most critics, and a \"throaty purr\".\n\nDuring her screen tests for To Have and Have Not (1944), Bacall was so nervous that, to minimize her quivering, she pressed her chin against her chest, faced the camera and tilted her eyes upward.  This effect, which came to be known as \"The Look\", became another Bacall trademark along with her sultry voice. \n\nBacall's character in the film used Slim Hawks' nickname \"Slim\", and Bogart used Howard Hawks' nickname \"Steve\". The on-set chemistry between the two was immediate according to Bacall.  She and Bogart (who was married at the time to Mayo Methot) began a romantic relationship several weeks into shooting.\n\nBacall's role in the script was originally much smaller, but during filming her part was revised multiple times to extend it into the lead part that it became in the released film. Once released, To Have and Have Not catapulted Bacall into instant stardom, and her performance became the cornerstone of her star image, the impact of which extended into popular culture at large, even influencing fashion,  as well as film makers and other actors.\n\nWarner Bros. launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote the picture and to establish Bacall as a movie star. As part of the public relations push, Bacall made a visit to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1945. It was there that Bacall's press agent, chief of publicity at Warner Bros. Charlie Enfield, asked the 20-year-old Bacall to sit on the piano while U.S. Vice President Harry S. Truman played.  \n\nAfter To Have and Have Not, Bacall was seen opposite Charles Boyer in Confidential Agent (1945), which was poorly received by critics. By her own estimation, it could have caused considerable damage to her career, had her performance as the mysterious, acid-tongued Vivian Rutledge in Hawks's film noir The Big Sleep (1946), co-starring Bogart, not provided a quick career resurgence. \n\nThe Big Sleep laid the foundation for her status as an icon of film noir. She would be strongly associated with the genre for the rest of her career,    and would often be cast as variations of the independent and sultry femme fatale character of Vivian she played in the movie.  As described by film scholar Joe McElhaney, \"Vivian displays an almost total command of movement and gesture. She never crawls.\" \n\nBacall was cast with Bogart in two more films. In Dark Passage (1947), another film noir, she played an enigmatic San Francisco artist. \"Miss Bacall -- generates quite a lot of pressure as a sharp-eyed, knows-what-she-wants girl\", wrote Bosley Crowther of The New York Times of her performance.   And, in 1948, she was in John Huston's melodramatic suspense film Key Largo with Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. In the film, according to film critic Jessica Kiang, \"Bacall brings an edge of ambivalence and independence to the role that makes her character much more interesting than was written.\" \n\n1950s\n\nBacall turned down scripts she did not find interesting, and thereby earned a reputation for being difficult. Despite this, she further solidified her star status in the 1950s by appearing as the leading lady in a string of films that won favorable reviews.\n\nBacall was cast opposite Gary Cooper in Bright Leaf (1950). In the same year, she played a two-faced femme fatale in Young Man with a Horn (1950), a jazz musical co-starring Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, and Hoagy Carmichael.\n\nDuring 1951\u20131952, Bacall co-starred with Bogart in the syndicated action-adventure radio series Bold Venture. \n\nIn 1953 she starred in the CinemaScope comedy How to Marry a Millionaire, a runaway hit among critics and at the box office.  Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, Bacall got positive notices for her turn as the witty gold-digger, Schatze Page.  \"First honors in spreading mirth go to Miss Bacall\", wrote Alton Cook in The New York World-Telegram & Sun. \"The most intelligent and predatory of the trio, she takes complete control of every scene with her acid delivery of viciously witty lines.\" \n\nAfter the success of How to Marry a Millionaire, she was offered, but declined, with Bogart's support, the coveted invitation from Grauman's Chinese Theatre to press her hand- and footprints in the theatre's cemented forecourt. But she felt at the time that \"anyone with a picture opening could be represented there, standards had been so lowered.\" She didn't feel she had yet achieved the status of a major star, and was thereby unworthy of the honor:  \"I want to feel I've earned my place with the best my business has produced.\"\n\nAt the time, Bacall was still under contract to 20th Century Fox. Following How to Marry a Millionaire, she appeared in yet another CinemaScope comedy directed by Jean Negulesco, Woman's World (1954), which failed to match its predecessor's success at the box office.  \n\nIn 1955 a television version of Bogart's breakthrough film, The Petrified Forest, was performed as a live installment of Producers' Showcase, a weekly dramatic anthology, featuring Bogart as Duke Mantee, Henry Fonda as Alan, and Bacall as Gabrielle, the part originally played in the 1936 movie by Bette Davis. Bogart had originally played the part on Broadway with the subsequent movie's star Leslie Howard, who had secured a film career for Bogart by insisting that Warner Bros. cast him in the movie instead of Edward G. Robinson; Bogart and Bacall named their daughter \"Leslie Howard Bogart\" in gratitude.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the 1955 performance to The Museum Of Television & Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles. \n\nIn 1955 Bacall starred in two feature films, The Cobweb and Blood Alley. Directed by Vincente Minnelli, The Cobweb takes place at a mental institution in which Bacall's character works as a therapist. It was her second collaboration with Charles Boyer and also starred Richard Widmark and Lillian Gish. \"In the only two really sympathetic roles, Mr. Widmark is excellent and Miss Bacall shrewdly underplays\", wrote The New York Times. \n\nMany film scholars consider Written on the Wind, directed by Douglas Sirk in 1956, to be a landmark work in the melodrama genre.  Appearing with Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack, Bacall played a career woman whose life is unexpectedly turned around by a family of oil magnates. Bacall wrote in her autobiography that she did not think much of the role, but reviews were favorable. Wrote Variety, \"Bacall registers strongly as a sensible girl swept into the madness of the oil family\". \n\nWhile struggling at home with Bogart's battle with esophageal cancer, Bacall starred with Gregory Peck in Designing Woman to solid reviews.  The musical comedy was her second feature with director Vincente Minnelli and was released in New York on May 16, 1957, four months after Bogart's death on January 14.\n\nBacall appeared in two more films in the 1950s: the Jean Negulesco-directed melodrama The Gift of Love (1958), which co-starred  Robert Stack; and the adventure film North West Frontier (1959), which was a box office hit. \n\n1960s and 1970s\n\nBacall's movie career waned in the 1960s, and she was seen in only a handful of films. She starred on Broadway in Goodbye, Charlie in 1959, and went on to have a successful on-stage career in Cactus Flower (1965), Applause (1970), and Woman of the Year (1981). She won Tony Awards for her performances in the latter two. \n\nApplause was a musical version of the film All About Eve, in which Bette Davis had starred as stage diva Margo Channing. According to Bacall's autobiography, she and a girlfriend won an opportunity in 1940 to meet her idol Bette Davis at Davis's hotel. Years later, Davis visited Bacall backstage to congratulate her on her performance in Applause. Davis told Bacall, \"You're the only one who could have played the part.\" \n\nThe few films Bacall made during this period were all-star vehicles such as Sex and the Single Girl (1964) with Henry Fonda, Tony Curtis, and Natalie Wood; Harper (1966) with Paul Newman, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris, Robert Wagner, and Janet Leigh; and Murder on the Orient Express (1974), with Ingrid Bergman, Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave, Martin Balsam, and Sean Connery.[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000002/?ref_\nnv_sr_1 Lauren Bacall - IMDb] Retrieved 2015-08-13\n\nIn 1964 she appeared in two episodes of Craig Stevens's Mr. Broadway: first in \"Take a Walk Through a Cemetery\", with then husband, Jason Robards, Jr., and later as Barbara Lake in the episode \"Something to Sing About\", co-starring future co-star Balsam. \n\nFor her work in the Chicago theatre, Bacall won the Sarah Siddons Award in 1972, and again in 1984.\n\nIn 1976 she co-starred with John Wayne in his last picture, The Shootist. The two became friends, despite significant political differences between them. They had previously worked together in Blood Alley (1955). \n\nLater career\n\nDuring the 1980s, Bacall appeared in the poorly received star vehicle The Fan (1981), as well as some star-studded features such as Robert Altman's Health (1980) and Michael Winner's Appointment with Death (1988). In 1990, she had a small role in Misery, which starred Kathy Bates and James Caan.\n\nIn 1997 Bacall was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role in The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996), her first nomination after a career span of more than fifty years. Bacall had already won a Golden Globe and was widely expected to win the Oscar, but lost in an upset to Juliette Binoche for The English Patient. \n\nBacall received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1997,  and in 1999, she was voted one of the 25 most significant female movie stars in history by the American Film Institute. Her movie career saw something of a renaissance, and she attracted respectful notices for her performances in high-profile projects such as Dogville (2003), Birth (2004), both with Nicole Kidman, and  in \"Howl's Moving Castle\" (2004), as the Witch of the Waste. She was a leading actor in Paul Schrader's The Walker (2007). \n\nIn 1999 Bacall starred on Broadway in a revival of No\u00ebl Coward's Waiting in the Wings. \n\nHer commercial ventures in the 2000s included being a spokesperson for the Tuesday Morning discount chain (commercials showed her in a limousine waiting for the store to open at the beginning of one of their sales events) and producing a jewelry line with the Weinman Brothers company. She previously was a celebrity spokesperson for High Point (coffee) and Fancy Feast cat food. In March 2006, Bacall was seen at the 78th Annual Academy Awards introducing a film montage dedicated to film noir. She made a cameo appearance as herself on The Sopranos, in the April 2006 episode, \"Luxury Lounge\", during which she was mugged by Chris Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli). \n\nIn September 2006, Bacall was awarded the first Katharine Hepburn Medal, which recognizes \"women whose lives, work and contributions embody the intelligence, drive and independence of the four-time-Oscar-winning actress\", by Bryn Mawr College's Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center.  She gave an address at the memorial service of Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. at the Reform Club in London in June 2007.  She finished her role in The Forger in 2009. \n\nBacall was selected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to receive an Honorary Academy Award. The award was presented at the inaugural Governors Awards on November 14, 2009. \n\nIn July 2013, Bacall expressed interest in taking the starring role in the film Trouble Is My Business.  In November, she joined the English dub voice cast for StudioCanal's animated film Ernest & Celestine.  Her final role was in 2014: a guest vocal appearance in the twelfth season Family Guy episode \"Mom's the Word\". \n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships and family\n\nOn May 21, 1945, Bacall married actor Humphrey Bogart. Their wedding and honeymoon took place at Malabar Farm, Lucas, Ohio, the country home of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louis Bromfield, a close friend of Bogart. The wedding was held in the Big House. \n\nBacall was 20 and Bogart was 45; thus, she was nicknamed \"Baby\". They remained married until Bogart's death from esophageal cancer in 1957. Pressed by interviewer Michael Parkinson to talk about her marriage to Bogart, and asked about her notable reluctance to do so, she replied that \"being a widow is not a profession\".  During the filming of The African Queen (1951), Bacall and Bogart became friends of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. She began to mix in non-acting circles, becoming friends with the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and the journalist Alistair Cooke. In 1952, she gave campaign speeches for Democratic Presidential contender Adlai Stevenson. Along with other Hollywood figures, Bacall was a staunch opponent of McCarthyism.  \n\nShortly after Bogart's death in 1957, Bacall had a relationship with singer and actor Frank Sinatra. During an interview with Turner Classic Movies's Robert Osborne, Bacall stated that she had ended the romance but in her autobiography, she wrote that Sinatra abruptly ended the relationship after becoming angry that the story of his proposal to Bacall had reached the press. When Bacall was out with her friend Irving Paul Lazar, they ran into the gossip columnist Louella Parsons, to whom Lazar revealed the details of the proposal. \n\nBacall later met actor Jason Robards. Their marriage was originally scheduled to take place in Vienna, Austria on June 16, 1961;  however, the plans were shelved after Austrian authorities refused to grant the pair a marriage license.  They were also refused a marriage in Las Vegas, Nevada.  On July 4, 1961, the couple drove all the way to Ensenada, Mexico, where they wed.  The couple divorced in 1969. According to Bacall's autobiography, she divorced Robards mainly because of his alcoholism. \n\nBacall had two children with Bogart and one with Robards. Son Stephen Humphrey Bogart (born January 6, 1949) is a news producer, documentary film maker, and author named after Bogart\u2019s character in \u201cTo Have and Have Not.\u201d  Her daughter Leslie Howard Bogart (born August 23, 1952) is named for actor Leslie Howard.  A nurse and yoga instructor, she is married to Erich Schiffmann. In his 1995 memoir, Stephen Bogart wrote, \u201cMy mother was a lapsed Jew, and my father was a lapsed Episcopalian,\u201d and that he and his sister were raised Episcopalian \u201cbecause my mother felt that would make life easier for Leslie and me during those post-World War II years.\u201d Sam Robards (born December 16, 1961), Bacall's son with Robards, is an actor. \n\nBacall wrote two autobiographies, Lauren Bacall By Myself (1978) and Now (1994).   In 2006, the first volume of Lauren Bacall By Myself was reprinted as By Myself and Then Some with an extra chapter. \n\nPolitical views\n\nBacall was a staunch liberal Democrat, and proclaimed her political views on numerous occasions. Bacall and Bogart were among about 80 Hollywood personalities to send a telegram protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations of \"Americans suspected of Communism\". The telegram said that investigating individuals' political beliefs violated the basic principles of American democracy. In October 1947, Bacall and Bogart traveled to Washington, D.C., along with a number of other Hollywood stars, in a group that called itself the Committee for the First Amendment (CFA), which also included Danny Kaye, John Garfield, Gene Kelly, John Huston, Ira Gershwin and Jane Wyatt.\n\nShe appeared alongside Humphrey Bogart in a photograph printed at the end of an article he wrote, titled \"I'm No Communist\", in the May 1948 edition of Photoplay magazine,  written to counteract negative publicity resulting from his appearance before the House Committee. Bogart and Bacall distanced themselves from the Hollywood Ten and said: \"We're about as much in favor of Communism as J. Edgar Hoover.\"  \n\nBacall campaigned for Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election, accompanying him on motorcades along with Bogart, and flying east to help in the final laps of Stevenson's campaign in New York and Chicago.  She also campaigned for Robert Kennedy in his 1964 run for the U.S. Senate. \n\nIn a 2005 interview with Larry King, Bacall described herself as \"anti-Republican... A liberal. The L-word.\" She added that \"being a liberal is the best thing on earth you can be. You are welcoming to everyone when you're a liberal. You do not have a small mind.\" \n\nDeath\n\nLauren Bacall died on August 12, 2014, at her longtime apartment in The Dakota, the Upper West Side building overlooking Central Park in Manhattan. She was 89, five weeks short of her 90th birthday.  According to her grandson Jamie Bogart, the actress died after suffering a massive stroke. She was confirmed dead at New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital.    She is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. \n\nBacall had an estimated $26.6 million estate, and in her will she left $10,000 to her youngest son, Sam Robards to take care of her dog, Sophie. Bacall also left money to two of her employees, Ilsa Hernandez and Maria Santos; Hernandez received $15,000 while Santos received $20,000. Bacall left $250,000 each to her youngest grandsons, the sons of Sam Robards for college, and the bulk of her estate was divided among her three children: Leslie Bogart, Stephen Humphrey Bogart, and Sam Robards.   She owned artworks by a number of artists, including John James Audubon, Max Ernst, David Hockney, Henry Moore and Jim Dine. \n\nThe Swedish Film Institute in G\u00e4rdet, \u00d6stermalm in Stockholm honored her with a special evening event three months after her death on November 12, 2014. Life magazine published a special edition about her life.  And Turner Classic Movies (TCM) produced two televised tributes to her, one narrated by Kelsey Grammer  and another narrated by Gregory Peck, a friend of hers since she was seventeen. \n\nIn a 1996 interview Bacall, reflecting on her life, told the interviewer that she had been lucky: \u201cI had one great marriage, I have three great children and four grandchildren. I am still alive. I still can function. I still can work,\u201d adding, \u201cYou just learn to cope with whatever you have to cope with. I spent my childhood in New York, riding on subways and buses. And you know what you learn if you\u2019re a New Yorker? The world doesn\u2019t owe you a damn thing.\u201d \n\nFilmography\n\nRadio appearances\n\nBooks\n\n* Lauren Bacall by Myself (1978)\n* Now (1994)\n* By Myself and Then Some (2005)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n* 1967 Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year\n* 1970 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, Applause \n* 1972 Sarah Siddons Award Actress of the Year\n* 1980 National Book Award in the one-year category: Autobiography[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1980.html \"National Book Awards \u2013 1980\"], nationalbook.org; retrieved March 16, 2012.This was the 1980 award for hardcover Autobiography.

                "title": "Rita Coolidge",
                "text": "Rita Coolidge\n(born May 1, 1945) is an American recording artist and songwriter. During the 1970s and 1980s, she charted hits on Billboards pop, country, adult contemporary and jazz charts and won two Grammy Awards with fellow musician and former husband Kris Kristofferson.\n\nEarly life\n\nCoolidge was born in Lafayette, Tennessee. Coolidge attended Nashville's Maplewood High School. She graduated from Andrew Jackson Senior High in Jacksonville, Florida. She is a member of Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.  She is of Scottish and self-identified Cherokee ancestry. \n\nCareer\n\nCoolidge is a graduate of Florida State University. After singing around Memphis (including a stint singing jingles), she was discovered by Delaney & Bonnie, who took her to Los Angeles where, besides her work with Delaney & Bonnie, she became a popular background singer on many other people's albums.  She sang for Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Graham Nash, and Stephen Stills. She was featured in Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour and album, singing Russell's and Bonnie Bramlett's song \"Superstar.\" She became known as \"The Delta Lady\" and inspired Russell to write a song of the same name for her. \n\nIn November 1970, she met Kris Kristofferson at the Los Angeles airport when they were both catching the same flight to Tennessee. He got off in Memphis with her, rather than continue to his intended destination in Nashville. The two married in 1973 and recorded several duet albums, which sold well and earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1974 for From the Bottle to the Bottom, and in 1976 for Lover Please.\n\nCoolidge's greatest success on the pop charts came during 1977\u20131978 with four consecutive top 25 hits, covers of Jackie Wilson's \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\", Boz Scaggs' \"We're All Alone\", The Temptations' \"The Way You Do The Things You Do\", and Marcia Hines' \"You\".\n\nCoolidge also was among the first hosts on VH1, a U.S. cable network. In 2006, Coolidge recorded a standards album, And So Is Love.\n\nLayla\n\nIn the recording of the original hit \"Layla\" by Eric Clapton's band Derek and the Dominoes in 1970, Clapton returned to the studio where he heard the band's drummer Jim Gordon playing a piano piece he had allegedly composed himself separately. Clapton, impressed by the piece, convinced Gordon to allow it to be used as part of the song in the coda section. Though only Gordon has been officially credited with this part, the band's keyboardist Bobby Whitlock claims, \"Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend Rita Coolidge. I know because in the Delaney & Bonnie days, I lived in John Garfield's old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called \"Time.\" Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with her husband, Booker T. Jones (of Booker T. & the M.G.'s). Jim took the melody from Rita's song and didn't give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off.\"  \"Time\" ended up on the 1973 album \"Chronicles\" by Booker T. and Priscilla. Jim Gordon was later convicted of killing his mother in 1983 after becoming schizophrenic and is still incarcerated as of 2015. \n\nPersonal life \n\nCoolidge is the daughter of \"Dick\" and Charlotte Coolidge, a minister and schoolteacher, with sisters Linda and Priscilla, and brother Raymond.  Coolidge was married to Kris Kristofferson from 1973 to 1980. They have one daughter, Casey. Coolidge previously had romantic liaisons with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash; her leaving Stills for Nash has been cited as a contributing factor behind the initial 1970 breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.  She was also involved with Leon Russell and Joe Cocker during their Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour. Coolidge married Tatsuya Suda on June 19, 2004 in the Cook Islands: Suda is a Japanese citizen who retired in 2010 after a tenure of over twenty-five years as a professor at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (UC Irvine).  \n\nRita's sister Priscilla Coolidge was also a singer & recording artist.  Priscilla married Booker T. Jones  of the popular '60s R&B band Booker T & The MG's in 1969, then married TV journalist/broadcaster/reporter Ed Bradley  in 1981, then married Michael Seibert.  Seibert & Priscilla were found dead in their home in October 2014 from what police called a murder-suicide allegedly perpetrated by Michael Seibert. \n\nCoolidge now lives in Fallbrook, California. She is currently a painter and has exhibited her work. Coolidge is also a sister of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.\n\nHer autobiography, Delta Lady: A Memoir, was published in April, 2016. \n\nWalela \n\nIn 1997, Coolidge was one of the founding members of Walela, a Native American music trio, that also included Priscilla and Priscilla's daughter Laura Satterfield.  The trio released studio albums in 1997 (Walela) and 2000 (Unbearable Love), a live album and DVD (Live in Concert) in 2004 and a compilation album (The Best of Walela) in 2007.   Walela means hummingbird in Cherokee.  Coolidge considered this group important, not only in honoring her Cherokee ancestors but also in bringing their culture to others.  Also as part of her Native American heritage, she performed with Robbie Robertson, who is Mohawk, at the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nDiscography \n\nAlbums (North American) \n\nAlbums with Kris Kristofferson \n\nInternational albums \n\nCompilation albums \n\nSingles \n\n* A B-side of \"Fever\"\n* B Charted as a double A-side in Australia, backed with \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\"",
