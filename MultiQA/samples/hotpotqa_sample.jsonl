Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\"  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.

The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of \"GMO free zones.\"  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.

He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota.  In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge.  The lodge has since burnt down.  He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property.  Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style.  The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built. ",

Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964.  The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable.  The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues.  \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.

The first series of these books was the \"Perfect Works\" series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube.  They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped in favor of the \"Ultimania\" (\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30de\u30cb\u30a2 , Arutimania ) series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania.  This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for \"Final Fantasy VII\".  They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003.  Square merged with video game publisher Enix on April 1, 2003 to form Square Enix, which resumed publication of the companion books. ",

An inscription on the minbar (\u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097.  It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid.  It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture.  It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque.  It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf.  Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen.  The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840.  Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French. ",

                "text": "Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.

                "text": "The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey. ",

Kansas City, Missouri was founded in 1838 and defeated its rival Westport to become the predominant city west of St. Louis.  The area played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States.  The Santa Fe, and Oregon trails ran through the area.  In 1854, when Kansas was opened to Euro-American settlement, the Missouri-Kansas border became the first battlefield in the conflict in the American Civil War. ",

It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City. ",

His debut album, 21 & Up was released on August 25, 2009.  The Ridgeway native was 16 when he made his professional foray into the music business.  Inspired by New Orleans\u2019 innovative Cash Money Crew, Ru began making a name for himself on his local music scene, doing live shows and pressing up his own CDs.  His hard-hitting lyrics and entrepreneurial spirit caught the attention of fellow South Carolinian Angie Stone.  Shortly after the neo-soul songstress helped him secure a deal with Elektra Records, Ru found himself unsigned again, among the artists lost in the shuffle after the label merged with Atlantic Records.  Music fans first heard him on his 2001 debut single Will Destroy.  He then released his 2002 follow up, Shawty What You Doin\u2019.  Both songs reached the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop charts and helped land him at his next label home, Capitol Records. ",
